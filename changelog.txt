	template patyh property.

06/02/04 STL port - added _STL namespace definitions to various
	low level STL functions, to be VC7.1 compatible.

06/02/04 Exporters - Fix rf3 export crsahes. (BZ# 8456).

06/02/04 Skeleton Update, and file system doc update
  Added more comments regarding the use of the MAX_NB_FILES_PER_FS
  macros. Added the value of the sector size in the appropriate file
  system init functions.

05/02/04 D3D9
  Added device release callbacks.

04/02/04 HAnim4 example.
  Check for failure when opening streams for writing.

04/02/04 3DsMax Particle Exporter Plugin
  Renamed the Particle Emitter Object from "RenderWare" to "RwEmitter".
  Moved the Emitter Point Helper into it's own RenderWare section of
  the Helpers.

04/02/04 Add export options override to Rf3Translator::GetAssetInfo().

03/02/04 File System IRX build
  Removed .tlb from project file.
  Fixed printf issue in rtfstype.h

03/02/02 PVS Converter
 Added support for lightmaps.

02/02/04 PVS Converter
  Added support for loading and saving RWS files from the PVS Converter.

02/02/04 PVS Editor
  Added support for loading and saving RWS files from the PVS Editor.

02/02/04 File System IRX
  Fix file system SleepThread issue that could cause problems with the 
  asynchronous streaming on the IOP. This SleepThread is only required 
  when a file is exclusively opened from the IOP.

30/01/04 PVS Edit
  Fixed a bug that was causing the PVS Editor to crash if it couldn't find 
  a texture when loading a bsp file.

30/01/04 RtLtMap (BZ#8320)
  Extreme value could lead the lightmap UV allocation to an inifinite loop. 
  This situation is now prevented.

30/01/04 File System (BZ#8380)
  Free file system device name on RtFSManagerUnregister.

30/01/04 File System
  Fixed issues causing problems with asynchronous streaming on the IOP. Whilst
  using a file on EE & IOP the file system was buffering ahead and interfering 
  with a seek that has been requested from the IOP.
  Fixed typo issue: the memeory allocation size on the IOP should be the number
  of stream on the EE plus the number of stream on the IOP (and not a multiplication).

30/01/04 Xbox (BZ#8369)
  Normalmap Skin plugin supports any set of texture coordinates when generating
  the binormals and tangents.

29/01/04 Open Export (BZ#8263)
  Added support for setting the solid background color for lightmaps from the
  asset template in the exporters.

27/01/04 (BZ#8270)
  Removed the old keyframe reduction code and added various new methods the best
  of which get 85% key reduction on the sample data. 

27/01/04 D3D9 (BZ#8348)
  Removed support for D3DDEVCAPS2_STREAMOFFSET on Radeon 7500.

23/01/04 Texture plugin data (BZ#6649)
  Made a change so that when a texture is read in multiple times (based on the
  texture name) we only read in the plugin data on the first read. This prevents
  some issues with userdata extensions to textures and should increase speed of
  streaming in textures slightly.

22/01/04 Open Export : 
  Added a project template flag to support aborting of an export when an 
  error occurs.

22/01/04 Sky2 EEI File System.
  Fixed semaphore issue occuring with scelibs 3.0.
  The new sce libs 3.0 checks that the maxCount specified on semaphore creation
  is not exceeded. The file system was failing this new check. Fixed by
  modifying the read handler callback and the associated fsync.

22/01/04 Open Export :
  Updated Audio Stream class to support ordering of segments and subs streams.

21/01/04 Open Export : Changed RwExpRpMaterial::CreateUVAnimation to be virtual
  to allow clean access to the RtAnimAnimation before anything is done to it.

21/01/04 (build) further alterations to newbuild.bat for active/dev eval 
  builds.

20/01/04 (BZ#8241) Fixed NormMap plugin for point lights.

20/01/04 D3D9 (BZ#8238) RpLtMap.
  Fixed inconsistent flag checking to choose render callback.

19/01/04 GCN (BZ#8197) The dual pass MatFX rendering pipelines were incorrectly
  setting up geometry dispatch for the second pass when using optimized geometry.

19/01/04 (build) looked at build issues, made some changes to newbuild.bat,
  makefile.main in both dev and 37active.

15/01/04 Build: RWONLYPLCORE
  This build option has been updated to perform a mandatory build of RtFSyst which
  plcore now has a dependency on as of RenderWare Graphics 3.7.

14/01/04 Update to StlPort 4.6
  So that the OpenExport API can be compiled against from Visual Studio .Net 2003
  we had to update our version of STLport to version 4.6.  This is the version
  that we are now using and distributing with our art tools.  
  NB the version of STLPort 4.6 we are distributing contains a few modifications 
  from the vanilla version in order to allow it to compile with our Open Export 
  STL wrappers.

14/01/04 GCN Upgraded the build machine to use,
  GCN_SDK_8-May-2003_Patch3

14/01/04 Xbox (BZ#8162) Added support for D3DPRESENTFLAG_EMULATE_REFRESH_RATE.

08/01/04 Xbox build machine upgraded to use the December 2003 SDK (#5849).

08/01/04 Added a Pre Instance option to the audio asset template (BZ#8075)
  This allows instancing to be turned off for specfic asset types in
  Open Export.

07/01/04 Open Export : Xbox audio data (BZ#8082)
  The Xbox platform specific data is now picked up correctly during export.

07/01/04 Core (BZ#8097)
  Added NULL pointer protection to arena closing code incase arena was
  initilised with size 0.

07/01/04 GCN File System
  Modified the DVD file system fsync function so that the operation completion  
  callback is triggered at the end of the operation. The current code could 
  trigger the callback even when the operation was not completed.

07/01/04 (build) modifying newbuild.bat for temp audio OE fix.

06/01/04 (build) modifying top level makefile for visualizer dll bug fix.

06/01/04 Windows File System 64-bit file size (BZ#8064)
  _rtFSIsEOF was not making the RtInt64 comparison correctly.
  Update of file position during a read was not done properly for 64-bit file
  size.

06/01/04 Open Export - Patched AddUserDataToWorldSector
  to prevent crash with redundant vertices in a scene (BZ#7041) 

06/01/04 File System 
  Modified TkSkyIOPFSystemFSync so that if it is called in a non-blocking mode
  the operation completion callback is not called if the status is still busy.
  Modified TkSkyIOPFSystemFOpen so that the ready status of the file is set
  before triggering the operation completion callback. This is to prevent the
  change of a file's status from busy to ready in the case where the callback
  requests another file operation which does not complete before the callback is 
  done.
  Modified the call to RwFSEETransferNotifyCompletion in RwFSSeekEE (rtfssiop.c)
  so that it passes the correct index.
  Added the RtSkyIOPFSystemSetEnableInterruptCB function to the EEI file system.
  This function can be used to set whether the operation completion callback is 
  triggered in interrupt mode (an interrupt is triggered for the read 
  completion).  

05/01/04 RF3 shaderlist
  Updated the Rf3 exporter to only save the shaderlist element if 
  one or more shaders exist.

05/01/04 File System 
  Removed the commented out RwFflush declaration in rtfsmgr.h

05/01/04 Visualizer Connection Wizard
  removed dependancies on rwsu.dll and rwscommsu.dll
  fixed crash bug that occurred after creating xbox connections
  fixed xbox default platform selection bug

05/01/04 Open Export - Fixed the RwExpExporter::Export() function 
  to check the return value of ApplyActions(). PostExport() will now be skipped if
  ApplyActions() does not return RwCOMM_SUCCESS.

05/01/04 RenderWare Exporters user data (BZ#8032)
  A fixed size buffer was being used in the rf3 exporter, now changed to a variable
  length to allow for large arrays of user data.

31/12/03 RenderWare Build Tool (BZ#8034)
  Context menus with greyed items over an application, when a build is running, had
  different actions to when they were not greyed.

31/12/03 OpenGL state call overkill (BZ#8033)
  Culling some unnecessary calls to query the current matrix mode in release builds.
  Debug builds assert whether the matrix mode is correct in some circumstances.
  Also RpCrowd now uses the RenderWare Graphics alpha test API for consistency.

31/12/03 OpenGL camera textures (BZ#8031)
  If a camera texture is rendered to, and then untextured geometry is rendered to
  a different camera immediately after, texturing is not disabled for that geometry
  due to a state inconsistency.

31/12/03 RF3 Translator - Add scripting support for message/progress
  notifications, via a dispatch interface.

30/12/03 RenderWare Graphics Build Tool (BZ#8030 enhancement)
  Output options are now stored persistently in the configuration file.

29/12/03 RenderWare Graphics Build Tool (partly BZ#7904)
  "Stop build" menu item now changes it's text depending on what kind of operation is
  running; build, clean, run, etc.

  Status bar is also context sensitive now rather than just saying "Building...".

18/12/03 Exporter Output Panel
  A problem that would stop the output panel in 3ds max and Maya from displaying
  new messages after 65k messages had been output has now been fixed.

17/12/03 RenderWare Graphics Build Tool (BZ#7900)
  If the build tool executable is run via the command line from a directory other
  than it's home directory then the configuration file fails to be located.
  Application now uses GetModuleFileName to determine the location of the configuration
  file.

17/12/03 Softras dual pass MatFX single UV set (BZ#7947)
  Dual pass effects with a single UV set that is shared among both passes is now
  supported.

17/12/03 Softras unmodulated material lighting (BZ#7943)
  Geometries with the modulate material flag unset were still being modulated.

15/12/03 launcher
  Added hidden EXPORTTOVIEW option inorder to allow visualization of 
  rf3 files which define custom export files.

15/12/03 2dviewer (BZ#6343)
  Removed the Restart Maestro menu option.

11/12/03 Non-Art Tools (BZ#7800) changed strview to close streams.

11/12/03 RenderWare Debug Handler
  The default debug handler has been removed from the Renderware debug handling
  process. Applications now need to register their own debug handler (no default
  is provided).

11/12/03 Exporters (BZ#7836) lower case texture name export bug fixed

09/12/03 Exporter pipeline overloading (BZ#7619)
  We now terminate searches on the NAPipeID rather than assuming we will find the 
  correct pipe.

09/12/03 D3D9 (BZ#7830) Prelight with dynamic lights and material color bug fixed.

08/12/2003 Core (BZ#7787) removed outdated unsupported function RwRGBAGetRasterPixel.

08/12/2003 GCN (BZ#7807) RpTeam skinning.
  Skinning was not working correctly when a hierarchy with multiple skins attached
  with 1 and greater than 1 weights.

07/12/2003 3ds max lightmap support
  Baked lightmap materials which are also sub materials are now correctly handled.

05/12/2003 OpenExport native light map support
  Changed OpenExport to set lightmapping flag for light mapped materials and objects containing 
  light mapped materials. 

05/12/2003 Core RasterRender (BZ#5853)
  Added asserts to stop RasterRender calls within a camera begin/end block.

04/12/2003 File system
  3.7 file system integration.
  All file operations now go through the file system toolkit. Renderware does not provide 
  a standard file interface (RwFileInterface) anymore. The file system toolkit provides a 
  standard ANSI-C file interface which can be used to perform synchronous and asynchronous 
  file operations. The completion of asynchronous file operations is now notified through
  callbacks. 
  The PS2 file system interface has been improved so that file operations on a common file
  can now be performed from both the EE and the IOP. The PS2 IOP module has also been improved 
  so that it now provides an asynchronous file interface.
  The PS2 DVD file system has been renamed to the EEI file system. This file system now provides
  the ability to use the IOP to access the HOST, the HDD, and the DVD. This can be done by 
  specifying a device type on file system initialisation. The device type can be changed at any time.

04/12/2003 Delete key (unexpectedly deletes assets) (BZ#7656)
  The delete key should not delete an asset while an asset entry is being modified
  i.e. you can pres 'Del' while editing an asset's asset template name without deleting
  the whole asset.

03/12/2003 D3D9 RpMatFX (BZ#7777)
  Restoring texture stages correctly after Dual Pass or EnvMap.

02/12/2003 Select Template dialog box problem. (BZ#7236)
  The "Select Template" dialog box is now fully re-sizeable.

28/11/03 Additional header file rwversion.h
  This contains version info previously contained in rwplcore.h. It is included
  by rwplcore.h.

27/11/03 OpenExport plugin loading
  Added popup dialog box for error messages when loading fails, with the
  option to prevent further warnings.

26/11/03 Background color
  The Background color of a scene can now be exported via the Background color setting
  in the rws options.  This setting defaults to off in new templates, but is enabled when
  a scene is viewed rather than exported.  In 3d Studio Max the color is extracted from
  the global rendering environment (Rendering>Environment>Background Color).  In Maya the
  color is taken from the relevant camera's background color.  The camera is chosen according 
  to the following rule - the first visible camera in the scene is used, and if there are 
  no visible cameras then the currently selected viewport's camera is used.

25/11/03 Auto clipping planes
  Camera clipping planes are now calculated more accurately in Max when
  a camera does not have manually specified clipping planes.  Also 
  rwCommScene now has a new member function GetBoundingBox which gets
  the bounding box associated with a scene.

25/11/03 VisualizerLauncher
  Added progress connection point to Rf3Translator com object.
  Changed launcher to a COM object to receive progress events.
  The launcher is now independent of RwComm.dll.

25/11/03 Bug Fix BZ#7649: changed thread safe file handle delivery to 
  semaphore rather than interrupt.

24/11/03 OpenExport
  Fixed bug with RwCommImage::SetPixel32 that could cause memory
  trampling.

24/11/03 PS2 build machine
  Updated to Sony Lib 3.0.0

21/11/03 rf3cc
  Added message connection point to Rf3Translator com object.
  Added command line message com object to rf3cc so rf3cc 
  is now independent of RwComm.dll.

20/11/03 static RwFrame support (BZ#6206) 
  static RwFrame support as been removed from the API. 
  The stealth function _rwFrameInit, _rwFrameDeInit, and 
  _rwFrameSetStaticPluginsSize can be used if needed.

20/11/03 RwFrame compatiblity macro
  The following compatibility macros has been removed :
  rwFrameGetParent (was calling _rwFrameGetParent)
  rwFrameInit (was calling _rwFrameInit)
  rwFrameDeInit (was calling _rwFrameDeInit)
  rwFrameCloneAndLinkClones (was calling _rwFrameCloneAndLinkClones)
  rwFramePurgeClone (was calling _rwFramePurgeClone)
  rwFrameClose (was calling _rwFrameClose)
  rwFrameOpen (was calling _rwFrameOpen)

20/11/03 D3D9 RpAnisot (BZ#7626) added checks for the magnification filter.

19/11/03 Max 6 exporter plugin stub
  Added plugin stub for Max 6. 

19/11/03 VisualizerLauncher 
  Updated VisualizerLauncher to use the RwRf3Translator COM object rather than
  linking directly to OpenExport dlls.

19/11/03 RpUserdata (BZ#7227)
  Fixed two potential memory leaks when dealing with string types in userdata.

18/11/03 Exporter plugin stubs
  Created Max 5 and Maya 5 plugin stubs to redirect to the open export bin 
  directory without needing to path this in.

18/11/03 RwBase classes
  Added RwUtilBase classes to RwUtil (see Open Export API docs for further info).
  These classes automate memory management for classes derived from them.  Comm
  objects, config objects and DOM objects now all derive off these base classes.
  THere is also a smart pointer RwUtilRCAutoPtr<T> that does reference counted
  smart pointing.  Although the pointer can be used with any class that has the 
  AddRef() and Release() functions it is recomended only for use with classes
  Derived off the relevant classes in RwUtilBase

18/11/03 UV Limiting changes
  Have made changes to the UV Limiting code so that it should now be faster and more
  robust.

18/11/03 RpGeometryAddRef now API (BZ#5165)
  RpGeometryAddRef is now API, a backwards compatibility macro is available for
  the previous stealth function name rpGeometryAddRef.

18/11/03 RenderWare Graphics Build Tool
  GDEV and GAMEOPTIX configurations added under GameCube builds.

17/11/03 RpPrtStd (BZ#6651)
  Cloning a PrtStd Atomic after it has been rendered now handle the 
  ptank platform flag correctly.
  
17/11/03 Xbox RpMatFX (BZ#7556)
  Modulate material color correctly for dual pass materials on geometries with prelit data.

13/11/03 Xbox RpTeam (BZ#7522) Removed legacy code for an unsupported feature.

13/11/03 New Plugin location and configuration code
  The registry reading code has been changed to allow access to multiple registry "trees"
  in keeping with the new registry layout.  Direct registry access from RwUtil is no longer
  recomended and instead the RwUtilConfig classes have been added to RwUtil to allow generalised
  "Configuration" access (see Open Export API docs for further info).

11/11/03 Light mapping
  Added support for multiply-instanced geometries to light mapping tool and plugin.

11/11/03 Exporters
  Fixed Patch skin splitting error (BZ#6937).

11/11/03 RenderWare Exporters (BZ#7428)
  Lightmap dump option now preserves colour depth.

11/11/03 RenderWare Graphics Build Tool (BZ#7401)
  Compiler sanity checks have been expanded for include and library environment variables
  distinguishing between "mandatory" and "optional" variables. Mandatory variables have
  the same response as previously - disallowing a build; optional variables will issue a 
  warning once (as issues may occur) but the build can continue.

11/11/03 RpCollis line iterator API modification
  RpSectorLineItInit and RpCollSectorLineItInit now take an additional 
  parameter. This is a vector specifying a +/- padding amount in X, Y, and Z,
  so that the query shape represents a swept axis aligned box rather
  than a line. The new parameter should be set to NULL for straightforward
  line queries. Swept boxes can be used to approximate fat lines or capsules.

10/11/03 Xbox RpSkin (BZ#7440) fixed bone weights range assert.

10/11/03 Memory allocation function __FILE__ and __LINE__ recording
  The default RwMalloc, RwCalloc and RwRealloc macros, in RWDEBUG SDKs, now also record
  the __FILE__ and __LINE__ at which they were called for later retrieval. These records
  are shared for all three macros, and do not provide any deeper history than the last
  call.
  Retrieval functions RwMemoryGetLastAllocFile and RwMemoryGetLastAllocLine have been
  added. These are only available in RWDEBUG SDKs, and any code using them should be
  predicated appropriately to avoid compilation errors.

10/11/03 OpenGL stencil functions (BZ#7405)
  OpenGL stencil functions now map correctly to the RenderWare Graphics enumeration.

06/11/03 Window sizing fix
  Window sizes are now stored and set via the window client size, rather than the full window size.
  This should fix some problems that were occurring with windows XP in the "XP theme" visual style
  where parts of dialogs were hidden.

06/11/03 (BZ#7055) Feature Request: 3ds Max coordinate system fix
  There is now a new export option that changes the way that the axis system "fix up"
  is applied.  You can now choose, instead of applying this fixup as a rotation to the
  root node of the animating hierarchy, to burn the axis system conversion in to all matrices
  and vertices exported in an animated hierarchy.

05/11/03 New message system
  The RwCommUserMeassage class has been added to the code base and RwCommMessage changed as a result
  Anyone wishing to override the message handling facilities of Open Export will have to update their 
  code as appropriate, however usage of the message facilities through the OUTPUT_MESSAGE macro remains
  unaffected

05/11/03 (BZ#7404) Fixed bounding sphere calculation in vclgenp and vclpipes examples

04/11/03 Exporters
  Fixed handling of referenced textures in Rf3 files so that they are correctly
  added to the shaders that use them.03/11/03 Exporters
  Added NULL RwCommScene safe guard to RwMaxRwMaterial.

03/11/03 D3D9 (BZ#7378) Fixed RwD3D9DDSTextureRead for Cubemaps.

30/10/03 D3D9 (BZ#7340) _rwD3D9CubeRasterCreate now supports camera textures.

29/10/03 Exporters (BZ#7314)
  Fixed RwPrtExpRpPrtSys::Export so it takes into account the SCALEFACTOR option
  properly.

29/10/03 Exporters (BZ#7330)
  Fixed RwMaxRwMaterial::IsExtensionEnabled when enquiring about lightmap
  flag.

23/10/03 Exporters (BZ#7221)
  Changed particle export Open Export plugin to work with method argument
  change.

22/10/03 Exporters (BZ#7221)
  Fixed Rf3 passing and RwMI not setting the RwCommObject pointer of
  RwCommUserDataCollection. This was causing a crash in rf3cc when
  exporting userdata for materials.
  Bumped up RwComm version string due to method argument change.

21/10/03 Xbox (BZ#7201)
  Checking geometry flags when instancing skinned atomics.

17/10/03 RtFsyst (BZ#6501)
  Added 2 macros to get the file position (RtFileSystemGetFilePosition)
  and the file size (RtFileSystemGetFileSize)

17/10/03 RenderWare Graphics Build Tool (BZ#7160)
  To ease the manipulation of build output, an option, in the File menu, to
  send the output directly to a text editor has been added.

17/10/03 RenderWare Graphics Build Tool (BZ#7154)
  Icons in the treeview window required a mask so that they did not appear
  with a white background on non-standard Windows color configurations.

16/10/03 RenderWare Graphics Build Tool (BZ#7150)
  Upon shutdown, if the resources need saving but the resource file is
  not available for write, the user is now provided with an option to
  retry if they can rectify the situation.

15/10/03 D3D (BZ#7129) added extra checks when the device is lost.

14/10/03 D3D9 (BZ#7105) Fixed debug counter for texture rasters.

14/10/03 RenderWare Graphics Build Tool (BZ#6017)
  Cygwin DLL version mismatches are now reported with error context in the
  build tool output window. The text that is looked for to determine the
  version mismatch is "shared version mismatch detected".

14/10/03 Xbox (BZ#7096)
  RwXboxSetRenderTarget not synchronized with RwCameraBeginUpdate, fixed.

14/10/03 Rt2D (BZ#6482)
  Removed an assertion on brush textures being loaded, this allows 2d
  to continue and render untextured geometry when textures are not used
  or not found.

13/10/03 OpenGL source and destination blend functions (BZ#7082)
  Added support for the GL_NV_blend_square extension that allows
  rwBLENDSRCCOLOR, rwBLENDINVSRCCOLOR to be used as source blends, and
  rwBLENDDESTCOLOR, rwBLENDINVDESTCOLOR to be used as destination
  blend functions.

09/10/03 3ds max 6 Exporter
  Added support for lightmapping in 3ds max 6. We now handle DX9 Shader
  materials which are linked to the lightmap.fx effect file shipped with 3ds max 6
  and export the lightmap data to RenderWare lightmaps. These DX9 shaders
  can easily be created using the Render To Texture dialog in 3ds max 6.
  The material export code is not hardcoded to look for the lightmap.fx file but
  instead parses the fx file linked to and looks for texture blocks using the
  semantic name "LightMap" (for the lightmap bitmap) and "DiffuseMap" (for lightmap
  generated diffuse bitmap). As long as these conventions are retained any fx
  file may be used to export as lightmap data.

09/10/03 Rt2d (BZ#6986)
  Fixed the processing of non newline terminated string. If a newline was
  not found, it can cause the font not to be loaded.
  Updated docs to stress each line in the metric file must be newline terminated.
  The font rendering now sets the texture filtering mode set in the texture.
  This will override the the filtering mode set externally. The font example
  now goes through and change the fonts' texture filer mode after loading.
  Added new unicode-met2 font to the font example.

09/10/03 D3D9 (BZ#7039) fixed reading mipmap levels of compressed textures
  from a texture dictionary.

08/10/03 ImportBuildSectorCompress 
  Checks have been added to ImportBuildSectorCompress to stop memory being
  trampled when the sector contains redundant vertices.  (BZ#6852)

07/10/03 Xbox build machine using August 2003 XDK with Integrated Hotfixes
         (#5659.4).

07/10/03 GCN Upgraded the build machine to use,
  GCN_SDK_8-May-2003_Patch2
  SocketLibraryPackage_beta_24-Sept-2003

07/10/03 (BZ#7006) GCN
  Added asserts to check for index count limit.

07/10/03 (BZ#7007) Exposed DMorph rpDMORPHNULLFRAME define.

07/10/03 RenderWare Graphics Build Tool (BZ#3993)
  Positioning the build tool window on a secondary monitor will now work correctly
  for all locations of the secondary desktop.

06/10/03 (BZ#6982) PS2 DVD File System
  Fixed bug in DVD file system read function: the function now checks if
  the start position of the read is sector aligned, and based on that either
  do a direct read or cached read. Because the interface between the EE and 
  the IOP is handled at a sector level (a seek will always seek to the start
  of the closest sector), the read must handle a possible offset between the
  seek requested and the seek done.

06/10/03 OpenGL vertex arrays and multitexture
  RwOpenGLSetActiveTextureUnit previously set both the active texunit (for binding
  textures) and the client active texunit (for setting vertex arrays). This has been
  separated so that RwOpenGLSetActiveTextureUnit only sets the active texunit. The
  client active texunit is managed automatically by the multitexturing vertex array
  RenderWare Graphics functions.

03/10/03 RwMeshSizeChecker BZ#6946 
  Changed error messages for mesh size checking and unweighted vertex checking
  so that they output the name of mesh that has failed the check.

02/10/03 HAnim assert (BZ#6910)
  Removed a potentially invalid assert designed to test hierarchy flags. The
  assert was invalidly firing during use of sub hierarchies and could also
  pass invalid flags in certain cases.

01/10/03 OpenGL normal raster dimensions (BZ#6954)
  Normal rasters are constrained to be power-of-two sides in OpenGL. This was
  previously unchecked and could cause a GL error.

01/10/03 OpenGL raster pixel access (BZ#6939)
  Fix for ensuring that color components from texture data returned by, and 
  written to, OpenGL are interpreted correctly.

30/09/03 PS2 RpPTank (BZ#6928) Memory wasn't totally freed.
  When using a ptank with 1 matrix per particles and instance buffering, 
  resource arena memory wasn't properly freed on destruction of the ptank's 
  atomic. Correct behavior is now implemented.

30/09/03 (BZ#6594) Frame Stream Read.
  Streamed in root frame are now properly flaged, according to the autoupdate 
  flag.

26/09/03 Xbox RpSkin (BZ#6896) Projection matrix set up fixed.

26/09/03 D3D9 (BZ#6891) Fixed RwD3D9DDSTextureRead to read correctly the
  lower mip levels of compressed textures.

25/09/03 PS2 RpTeam (BZ#6885) Reset fog color if rendering without shadows
  RpTeam environment mapping pipelines have been updated to reset the
  fog color after rendering. This stops the leaking of a dark fog 
  render state when the number of shadows is zero.
 
23/09/03 Xbox (BZ#6835) Fixed IM2d when using supersampling.

22/09/03 (BZ#5226) Tex Limit Error message
  Have modified error reporting to avoid duplicate messages when a texture
  is missing from a scene.  Now if a texture is missing there is a single
  warning saying which texture is missing and specifying any objects which
  have had texel based UV limiting affected by the lack of the texture.

22/09/03 RtLtMap - Removed assertion when trying to create/load lightmap 
 bigger than 512x512.
 Be aware that using lightmaps bigger than 512x512 might cause 
 rendering performance problems.

19/09/03 Fixed bug where multi sub materials within 3dsmax5 would not pickup
  and export the native lightmaps. This required adding an API function to 
  RwMaxRwMaterial. The RwComm version has been updated to 3.6.0.2.

18/09/03 (BZ#6230) Export of skinned patches in BSPs.
  Have added a check to allow tesselation (and hence export) of skinned
  patches when they are not being exported as animating hierarchies. 

17/09/03 Normal Map Plugin D3D9 (BZ#6732) fixed fog on NVidia video cards.

17/09/03 OpenGL cameras without Z-buffers, BZ#6718
  If a camera does not have a Z-buffer, Z-writes and Z-tests are disabled
  at RwCameraBeginUpdate, and restored (if necessary) at RwCameraEndUpdate.

17/09/03 PS2 texture cache
  RpSkyTexCacheFlush() now always clears skyTexCache.currentRaster.

17/09/03 PS2 16 bit 480P mode
  Added a 16 bit deep 480P video mode. This changes the mode number of the
  default video mode by 1.

17/09/03 PS2 RwEngineSetVideoMode
  Now primes the structure returned by RpSkyGetModeStructurePtr() so that
  it is easier to create a mode that is a variation of the standard ones.
  It is necessary to set the Mode to -1 after altering the contents of
  the structure if you wish to use it.

16/09/03 PS2 RpTeam (BZ#6571) -1.0f right vector scaling in root of hierarchy.
  RpTeam static rendering code has been updated to support a -1.0f right
  vector in the root of the player hierarchy. Requested by customers wishing
  to render left-handed players with right-handed assets.

15/09/03 RpSkin Xbox (BZ#6580).
  Fixed support for the ambient coefficient in RwSurfaceProperties.

12/09/03 RtTOC (BZ#6481) : RtTOC now support rwID_UVANIMDICT.

12/09/03 RpPrtStd (BZ#5682)
  Fixed the passing of the user data pointer down the to the callbacks.
  RpPrtStdEmitterCreate has been changed to accept the new parameter.

12/09/03 (BZ#4417) : the camera begin update now use an actual orthonormality 
  test, rather than relying only on the rwMATRIXTYPEORTHONORMAL flag.
  If a non orthonormal camera matrix is used, an assertion will be thrown.
  If the matrix is orthonormal but not flagged property, a message will be 
  outputed once.

08/09/03 Xbox (BZ#6513) Fixed a bug when recreating a raster every frame.

03/09/03 RtAnimKeyFrameApply (BZ#6074)
  Fixed the parameters used in the release build macro version of
  RtAnimKeyFrameApplyMacro. Previously this would've failed to compile if
  used.
25/
02/09/03 D3D9 (BZ#6470) Skin MatFX dual pass UV anim fixed.

29/08/03 PS2 build machine
  The build machine for the PS2 version of RenderWare has been upgraded to
  Sony libs 2.8.1

28/08/03 (BZ#6331) RwMaxShader using bumpmap strengh for all textures.
  The correct channels factor is now used.

28/08/03 The CreateAsset() MaxScript function (BZ#6302)
  Added functionality to this function to pick up multiple selections
  when creating an asset.

28/08/03 RpPTank PS2 (BZ#5834) : added warning concerning the use of
  RpPTankAtomicSkyRenderStateSet and RpPTankAtomicSetBlendModes during the
  same frame.

28/08/03 Xbox & D3D (BZ#6400) 4444 DDS textures don't load, fixed.

26/08/03 Exporters  (BZ#6191)
When burning self illumination into vertex prelights the prelight colors are correctly
clamped afterwards.

26/08/03 RpSplineRead & RpSplineWrite (BZ#6191)
  Changed the filename parameter to the above functions to take a const RwChar *
  rather than RwChar *

26/08/03 RtAnimInterpolatorSetCurrentAnim (BZ#5055)
  Added an assert that the number of frames in an animation is at least twice
  the number of nodes in the interpolator, this number of keyframes are accessed
  during animation initialization.

26/08/03 RpHAnimHierarchySetFlags (BZ#6358)
  In release build this function was converted to a macro and wasn't returning
  a value like the function. This has been corrected to return the hierarchy
  pointer to match the function implementation.

26/08/03 PS2 (BZ#6214) Matfx DualPass
  Instancing code now supports reusing the first set of texture coordinates
  for dual pass world sector meshes.

22/08/03 D3D9 (BZ#6335) Dmorph and normal mapping dont work together, fixed.

20/08/03 OpenGL raster update
  RenderWare Graphics OpenGL raster support has been upgraded. All raster formats
  except rwRASTERFORMATLUM8 and the palettized formats are now available.

  Texture compression is available (where supported) using generic compressed
  formats for rasters of type rwRASTERTYPETEXTURE, which are compressed by the
  video card driver. This feature must be enabled by the application (by default
  it is disabled), but there are some caveats that are discussed in the documentation.

  DXTn (for n=1,3,5) compressed textures may be loaded from .dds files and stored
  in compressed formats in RwRasters. Additional API functions have been exposed to
  load from .dds files. DXTn compressed rasters may be streamed in
  compressed format in OpenGL texture dictionaries.

  Hardware mip generation is available (where supported) for RwRasters flagged as
  rwRASTERFORMATMIPMAP and rwRASTERFORMATAUTOMIPMAP. These rasters may be streamed
  into OpenGL texture dictionaries (but only storing the top level mip).

  Cube maps may be read from compressed .dds files. RpMatFX environment mapping has
  been extended to use cube maps as the environment map texture. Cube map rasters may
  be streamed into OpenGL texture dictionaries.

  CurrentVersion has been increased to 0x37001 in respect of the change in the OpenGL
  texture dictionary format.

  For additional details on these new features, please see the OpenGL whitepaper and
  the API reference.

19/08/03 Xbox build machine upgraded to use the August 2003 SDK (#5659).

18/08/03 Xbox (BZ#6264) RpMatfx
  Removed redundant calls to _rxXbDefaultRenderFFPMeshSetUp.

18/08/03 (BZ#6164) RpNormMap works now without a base texture.

18/08/03 GCN Upgraded the build machine to use,
  GCN_SDK_8-May-2003_Patch1
  NetworkBasePackage_05-Aug-2003
  CW_GAMECUBE_R2.6

13/08/03 D3D9 skinning without hierarchies (BZ#6205)
  Correcting flags passed to _rpD3D9SkinGeometryReinstance from _rxD3D9SkinInstance in order
  for the base pose to be instanced if no hierarchy exists.

13/08/03 Exporters
  Memory leak when not exporting per polygon or per vertex user data on a world, fixed.
  Memory leak when not exporting per polygon or per vertex toon data on a world, and
  exporting the world as toon, fixed.

13/08/03 PS2 (BZ#6093) Incorrect assert on maximum number of skinning matrices.
  Corrected to rpSKINMAXNUMBEROFMATRICES >= numMatrices.

13/08/03 D3D9 compressed texture dictionary streaming (BZ#6184)
  Compressed DXTn textures, streamed from DDS files, are not flagged as compressed and
  subsequent streaming to a D3D9 texture dictionary inflates the size of the dictionary
  unnecessarily.

  Cubemaps streamed to a D3D9 texture dictionary would fail due to incorrectly
  calculated native sizes.

  Note that texture dictionaries should be regenerated to ensure proper function if they
  contain compressed textures or cubemaps.

13/08/03 (BZ#6062) Maya RenderWare particles created before Rw3.6 are missing attributes
  for rotation. Some update code has been added to the mel script to check for the missing
  attributes and add them if missing.

12/08/03 (BZ#6065) Animated cylinder emitter Maya orientation fix
  Cylinder emitters exported as part of an animated hierarchy from Maya are now
  orientated correctly. Added generic shape orientation code to RwCommShape to
  deal with this situation.

12/08/03 Rt2d. Bug fix.
  Fixed rendering of very small fonts. The font's uv are offset by 0.5 so the font's bitmap
  is sampled at pixel center.
  Metric 2 font chars are now slightly bigger by 1 pixel. This may affect the
  positioning of some strings.

12/08/03 Exporters (BZ#6005)
  When deleting child assets from the asset manager dialog the parent asset child
  list is now correctly updated.

11/08/03 Fixed maestro animations for complex multi-sub-animation cases (5626)
  When an animation is endlooped, child animations are forcibly endlooped too
  Computation of time-step made robust
  Export no longer attempts to reuse temporarily-unused static objects; this
  removes some brief visual glitches on animation restarts

08/08/03 RtSlctPipe - ADC requirement extracted from ADC plugin data
  instead of input flag.

07/08/03 Exporters
  Add ADC processing option to the platform specific sections of the asset
  templates. This allows the user to control whether exported RpWorld and
  RpGeometry objects are processed for use by ADC rendering pipes.
  Because this changes some template files the template version has been
  updated to 3.6.0.1.

07/08/03 Exporters
  Added ability to override render pipes to customer specific pipe ids. Previously
  the source and destination pipes for all pipe override template options had to
  be specified using the standard RenderWare name for that pipe. The destination
  pipe may now also be specified using any integer (stored as a string option).  This
  allows customers to override to their own custom pipe ids. More output has also
  been added to assist in checking that pipe overrides have been processed
  correctly.
  Because this changes the interface to RwExpDffExporter and RwExpBspExporter
  the RwComm version has been updated to 3.6.0.1.

07/08/03 Visualizer
  The license is about to expire message box now displays correctly on Japanese
  systems.

07/08/03 Exporters - removed the 3dsmax NO_EXTRA_KEYFRAMES option, and
  removed the actual addition of extra key frames for Max smooth curve
  controllers. In order to reduce interpolation differences between 3dsmax
  smooth curve controllers and linear RenderWare animation we now recommend
  that the dynamic keyframe generation option is used.

05/08/03 PS2 dma crash due to Im3D
  Added code to prevent RwIm3DPS2AllBridgeCallBack adding an unnecessary
  PURef packet which might cause a dma crash.

31/07/03 (BZ#5970) rtfsyst broken under Win98, fixed.

31/07/03 (BZ#5528) Max Editable Poly vertex animation
  fixed export of morph targets on Editable Poly objects in max.

31/07/03 D3D9 (BZ#5948) RwD3D9DDSTextureRead
  Added a warning message if the file could not be found.

31/07/03 RpTeam PS2 BZ#5959
  Forced alignment of all qwords used in packet building. This was causing the
  static rendering pipeline to operate incorrectly.

30/07/03 RtGCond
  Following functions now return RwBool value to indicate if they were
  successful or not:
  RtGCondAllocateVertices(), RtGCondReallocateVertices(),
  RtGCondAllocatePolygons(), RtGCondReallocatePolygons(),
  RtGCondAllocateIndices(),  RtGCondReallocateIndices()
  Also pInternalData is removed from the RtGCondVertex structure

28/07/03 Visualizer launcher uvanim support for legacy formats
  Now loads .uva for .dff and .bsp

28/07/03 D3D8 and D3D9 (BZ#5882)
  Fixed incorrect stream size of native data.

28/07/03 RtGCond & RtWing BZ#5848
  Removed raw math calls from RtGCond and RtWing to prevent unnecessary
  double precision conversions.

28/07/03 Rt2D BZ#5848
  Remove unnecessary double precision conversions from Rt2d.

28/07/03 RtMipK BZ#5848
  Change calls of log to RwLog and fabs to RwFabs to prevent unnecessary
  double precision conversions.

25/07/03 #BZ5799 - RtLtMapCnv
  Imported lightmap UVs limitation breach ( out of [0.0/0.0 to 1.0/1.0] )
  won't crash any more, a warning will instead be generated.

25/07/03 Xbox normal map instancing / visualization
  Normal map plugin now used by visualizer when launching .dff/.bsp
  files (BZ #5836) in instancer xbox custom instancing dll (BZ #5571)
  in  XBox FX editor

25/07/03 Visualizer launcher UVAnim support for .dff / .bsp

25/07/03 PVS BZ#5848
  Removed any use of double precision floats from RpPVS

25/07/03 Xbox, fixed a bug when rendering 2D primitives to a subraster.

25/07/03 BZ#5850, Removal of D3D7 driver references
  Generating texture dictionary names in the dpvsview example, clmpview
  and wrldview viewers were still referring to the D3D7 driver, and some
  were missing D3D8 and D3D9 variations.

25/07/03 RtImport and RtGCond
  Geometry conditioning was not done properly when calcNormals flag is
  set in the RtWorldImportParameters. That is fixed, and calculation
  of normals is now exposed through RtGCondBuildNormalsPipelineNode()

24/07/03 BZ#5461 - Worldview
  Added lightmap and matfx support.

24/07/03 Example Skeleton - gcn
  added broadband adaptor support.
  added usb adaptor support.
  added pure ANSI file functions support.

24/07/03 RtFSyst - gcn
   added broadband adaptor support.

22/07/03 RpCollis plugin (BZ#5783)
  Global variables _rpCollisionGeometryDataOffset and
  _rpCollisionWorldSectorDataOffset moved to extern "C" block.

22/07/03 RtWing - RtWingCreate function now creates crease edges and
  terminals edges between materials. This will prevent and fix cracks
  that could occur between objects.

22/07/03 Exporters - Vertex welding for Static Worlds is now done per
  the entire world, not per each mesh as before. This should fix cracks
  that could've occur between objects.

22/07/03 Skeleton - ps2
  Added atmon file system support.
  Added call to mwInit()/mwExit() for RenderWare AI

21/07/03 RtGCond - Various bug fixes.

21/07/03 (build) second expression for gnufind prevents command
  from successfully generating a full list. Todos should now be
  deleted from the src.

17/07/03 Exporters and polygon welding using RtGCond
  For very big scenes RtGCond uses a lot of memory so it may have crashed
  for those reasons when run from 3ds max or maya. That is fixed now, so it
  will print out an error saying it failed to do polygon welding. A work
  around is to export a scene to rf3 and then export it using rf3cc.exe
  which uses much less memory then 3ds max or maya.

17/07/03 Change RwCameraSetViewWindow assert to assert if the given width
  or height isn't greater then 0.

17/07/03 Font example (BZ#5587)
  Fixed crash due to missing fonts. Added check and error message if a font
  was not found.

17/07/03 RpWorld (BZ#5601)
  Fixed memory leak from RpWorldStreamRead if it fails to load the world.

17/07/03 RtImport (BZ#5659)
  Removed a call to RwRealloc that is not needed and causes the code
  to crash in some situations.

17/07/03 RenderWare Graphics Build Tool BZ#5661
  A crash occurred if an environment variable for compiler command line use
  was not in an expected format.

11/07/03 RtGCond
  Function RtGCondNormalize now returns FALSE if the vector provided is
  too close to zero-length vector, and doesn't do anything.
  Function RtGCondColinearVertices now takes tolerance parameter.
  Various bug fixes.

10/07/03 RenderWare Stack Depth Checking
  By default RenderWare no longer performs stack depth checking
  within RenderWare API calls. This has been removed since it wasn't
  thread safe and could report false errors in multithreaded applications.
  Custom builds of RenderWare can still be performed with stack depth
  checking enabled.

09/07/03 RtFSyst
  Modified the evaluation of the mode passed to rwfopen
  Windows version of filesystem now respect append and read/write mode.
  XBox version of filesystem now respect append and read/write mode.

09/07/03 RenderWare Version Changes
  CurrentVersion has been increase to 0x37000 and BaseVersion has
  been increased to 0x35000. Hence any artwork from before 0x35000
  will no longer be supported and will need conversion with a 3.6 or
  earlier release.

08/07/03 Removed unused rcsid tags from entire source base.

08/07/03 RtFSyst
  Modification to the file system following bug raised by RWA.
  The attribution of file handles is now thread safe. On PS2
  and GCN this was solved by disabling interrupt around the piece of
  code that delivers file handles, as well as during the file
  closing process. On Xbox and PC this was done by defining a
  CRITICAL_SECTION around the piece of code that should be
  synchronized.

07/07/03 RenderWare Graphics DLL builds
  For COPTIMIZE=1 builds, increased the compiler optimization level to
  -O2 -Ob2.

04/07/03 GCN (BZ#5498) GCN pre-inst optimisation bug fixed.

01/07/03 Exporters
  Added options for controlling lightmap color depth and mipmapping to
  the animated hierarchy and static world templates.

01/07/03 findsyms
  PS2 CodeWarrior version updated to function correctly when symobols
  are in .data/.bss rather than .sdata/.sbss

30/06/03 Patch prelight instancing (OpenGL & GameCube) BZ#5442
  Patch atomics with more than one mesh and prelight data would only
  instance the first mesh, causing an exception error.

30/06/03 PS2 New build option NOSMALLDTA
  Adding NOSMALLDATA=1 to the PS2 build options will build with -G0 or
  -sdatathreshold 0 as appropriate.

30/06/03 GCN
  Enabled __LESS_ACCURATE_FP__ for CodeWarrior library builds.

30/06/03 Updated the gamecube effect dictionaries to version 3.6.

27/06/03 BZ#5120  SLX ID t9VZZA000HHD
  Add check to reject rendering to a camera larger than the draw buffer.

27/06/03 PS2 build machine
  Now on Sony 2.8.0

26/06/03 RpTeam - Adding RpTeamRenderMode flags to RpTeamRender function.
  This allows application control of the RpTeamRender functions.
  If original functionality is required use rpTEAMRENDERALL.

25/06/03 OpenExport - Renamed GetObject() Functions (BZ#5347)
  Renamed all OpenExport class member functions named GetObject to
  stop them being renamed to GetObjectA when the wingdi.h header is
  included.

  In the following classes GetObject is now named GetCommObject:
    RwCommScene
    RwExpTraverseObject
    RwMaxScene
    RwMayaScene

  In the following classes GetObject is now named GetMObject:
    RwMayaAnimCurve
    RwMayaCreationData
    RwMayaMotionPath

25/06/03 Exporters - Added warning if the same texture is used with multiple
  alpha textures (the first combination will be the exported one).

25/06/03 Exporters - Asset Manager Control
  When changing the export template of an asset to a different
  template with the same asset type the per-asset artist options are
  no longer reset. They are however still reset when changing to an
  export template of a different asset type.

25/06/03 Exporters - Asset Manager Control
  Custom asset export locations may now be set by typing directly
  into the file cell (as well as by using the browse button).

25/06/03 Softras lightmapped atomics not rendered (BZ#5406)
  Lightmapped atomics were not rendered.

24/06/03 LtMap - Added density evaluation functions :
  RtLtMapWorldCalculateDensity will calculate a density value for a world
  RtLtMapAtomicCalculateDensity will calculate a density value for an atomic

24/06/03 GCN Upgraded the build machine to use,
  DolphinSDK1.0 8th May 2003
  CodwWarrior CW_GAMECUBE_R2.5 + CW_GAMECUBE_R2.5.2_Update.

23/06/03 Palette Quantization (BZ#5025)
  Fix to RwPalQuant to improve 4 and 8 bit palette generation for textures
  of low color contrast. The problems were particularly apparent when generating
  palettized textures on PS2, due to accumulation of FPU truncation errors.

23/06/03 3ds max and Maya Exporters
  The redraw time of the Asset Manager control has been significantly improved
  for scenes with large numbers of assets.

21/06/03 3ds max and Maya Exporters
  The Embed TOC project template option is now disabled by default on all platforms.

21/06/03 3ds max and Maya Exporters
  The limit UV option is now enabled by default in the PS2 project template.

21/06/03 3ds max and Maya Exporters
  The Visualize Partitions option is now correctly honoured when upgrading
  3.4 batch export nodes.

20/06/03 3ds max Exporters
  We used to auto create a spline asset only if it used to be on top of the
  hierarchy and then we would ignore the rest of the hierarchy. Now spline
  asset creation happens at the end, so all assets will be created as without
  any splines in the scene and then one spline asset will be added for every
  spline in the scene.

20/06/03 Exporters - Fixed random crash when exporting a skin with Edit Normal modifer
  and the time slider isn't at the start.

20/06/03 3ds Max Exporter
  When upgrading 3ds Max scenes from the 3.4 release the exporter now
  correctly upgrades the tristrip method option on dff export nodes.

20/06/03 Maya Exporter
  The Maya exporter now honours the export selection button when upgrading
  3.4 Maya bsp export nodes.

20/06/03 Maya Exporter
  We are adding keyframes between every two rotation keyframes with rotation
  bigger then 180 degrees. In case of corrupted motion capture data, with very
  big rotations, we would add a lot of keyframes between every two keyframes,
  which could lead to a crash. Now that is fixed and that number is limited to
  10 keyframes.

20/06/03 RenderWare Graphics Build tool (BZ#5342)
  Fixed crash, if no source tree was selected and "distclean" opted for.

19/06/03 Exporters - rf3
  Name attributes in rf3 are now changed to be valid xml names, which means they must
  start with (Letter | '_' | ':'), and then can only have one of the name characters:
  (Letter | Digit | '.' | '-' | '_' | ':') If that's not fulfilled, underscore will be
  pre-appended and/or all invalid characters will be replaced with underscores. If for
  any reason names had to be changed, a new attribute called "sourcename" will be
  added containing the original name. Note names in rf3 files are also made unique.

19/06/03 PS2 PrtStd - buffer usage functionality
  PrtStd will now warn the user when attempting to update a buffer while it's
  still get rendered. See RpPrtStd API reference, playstation 2 overview, for
  details about how to avoid synchronisation problems.
  Modified PrtStd, PrtStd2 and PrtAdv examples to avoid synchronisations
  issues.

19/06/03 PS2 PTank - buffer usage check functions
  RpPTankAtomicSkySwapFrames now return TRUE when the current buffer is ready
  for update.
  RpPTankAtomicSkyCurrentBufferStatus return the state of the current buffer,
  TRUE if buffer is editable, FALSE if not.

19/06/03 OpenExport
  The OpenExport examples have all been updated with a new "Hybrid" build
  configuration. The Hybrid configuration builds a debug binary but links against
  the release multithreaded dll runtime library. This is suitable for debugging
  when using the release 3ds max or maya plugins and OpenExport dlls. When
  using the debug 3ds max or maya plugins and OpenExport dlls the debug
  configuration should be used.

19/06/03 OpenExport
  Added support for new RW_HYBRID_BUILD preprocessor define. This should
  be set by OpenExport plugins that are built in debug mode and linked against
  the release OpenExport dlls and runtime libraries. When set this this define
  performs the same operation as the _NODBGCHECK define. It also ensures
  that the Microsoft STL implementation links against the release runtime libs.

  The _NODBGCHECK define is now considered legacy and should be replaced by
  RW_HYBRID_BUILD.

19/06/03 OpenGL MatFX UV transformations and NULL base transform matrix (BZ#5339)
  The NULL base transform matrix for a single UV transform was not handled
  correctly as the identity matrix.

18/06/03 Exporters - Modify dynamic key frame generation to work with higher
  tolerance values. Set the default tolerane value to 50%. Note that the previous
  default value (10%) will now generate more key frames than it used to.

18/06/03 RtLtMap - RtLtMapSkyLightMapMakeDarkMap and 24bpp rasters (BZ#4930)
  RtLtMapSkyLightMapMakeDarkMap was not handling 24bpp rasters.

18/06/03 Exporters - Changed asset path comparing to be caseless. Prevents
duplicate file exports due to name case.

17/06/03 Exporters - Add in warning messages if UV animation is being exported
  and material isn't setup for it. Improved material animation warning in Maya
  to avoid uv animation.

17/06/03 Exporters - Removal of dgdirty mel call. Was put in for Maya3 bug
  which was fixed in Maya4.

17/06/03 OpenGL MatFX envmap + no base texture + prelight + multipass (BZ#5291)
  Without a base texture, the prelight is modulated with the envmap in the
  second pass. The prelight should only be in the first pass.

17/06/03 Exporters - before exporting a skinned geometry from a different
  hierarchy, check that all of it's transform hierarachy is visible. (BZ#5202)

13/06/03 WorldSector API changes/additions
  Added RpWorldSectorGetTriangles, RpWorldSectorGetVertices.
  Changed RpWorldSectorGetNumPolygons to RpWorldSectorGetNumTriangles
  (with macro for backward compatibility).

12/06/03 RpPolygon has been removed.
  RpWorldSector now uses RpTriangle instead of RpPolygon.

  RpWorldSector elements renamed,

  numPolygons -> numTriangles
  polygons    -> triangles

11/06/03 RpMipKL attachment asserts (BZ#4958)
  Added asserts to the api functions to ensure that the plugin has been
  attached.

11/06/03 Skeleton VectorFont Code (BZ#4682)
  Fixed a small memory leak when vector fonts are destroyed.

11/06/03 OpenGL RwRasterRender (BZ#5177)
  This function would cause some of the render state cache to be out
  of sync, most notibly in textured geometry.

11/06/03 RtCharsetSetColors & RtCharsetDestroy (BZ#4367)
  Calls to RtCharsetSetColors & RtCharsetDestroy would previously call
  RtCharsetBufferFlush to flush unprinted characters before modification
  of the charset. Because these could be called outside a camera begin/end
  scope it wass invalid to call bufferflush. The call in RtCharsetDestroy has
  been replaced by an assert. The call in RtCharsetSetColors has been
  removed since the documentation already stated that the colors of buffered
  text would be changed, hence the code now correctly matches the definition
  of the function in the documentation.

10/06/03 PS2 makefiles (BZ#5141)
  New make variable, SCE. If not defined defaults to /usr/local/sce or
  $(PS2_DRIVE):/usr/local/sce. Used to locate headers, etc.

10/06/03 Exporters - Removal of hybrid build "Debug" from exporter
examples. "Debug" is now what was "Full Debug" (building
against the debug exporter libs). This prevents stl release/debug
memory management mixing.

10/06/03 XBox (BZ#5153) MatFX displaying material color incorrectly.

10/06/03 RtGcond - Added functions to enable texel based UV limiting.
  New functions are:
      RtGCondInitialize()
      RtGCondMaterialGetUVLimits()
      RtGCondMaterialSetUVLimits()
  and RtGCondLimitUVsPipelineNode function takes additional texelLimits
  parameter to specify if per material per UV set texel based limits
  should be used. The RtGCond toolkit must be now initialized after
  initializing the system with RwEngineInit and calling
  RpWorldPluginAttach, and before opening the system with \ref RwEngineOpen.
  Refer to API docs for more information.

10/06/03 OpenGL RpPTank, atomics with non-identity LTMs (BZ#5158)
  Atomics satifying this criteria were rendered incorrectly.

06/06/03 Exporters - Bug fix to changed way transform are obtained during
 character studio top level keyframe filter. Now only transforms names are
 compared.

05/06/03 RpPTank - RpPTankAtomicSetMaterial BZ#4869
  RpPTankAtomicSetMaterial is now correctly setting the material in the PTank
  atomic according to the platforms needs.

05/06/03 RpPTank doesn't handle rpPTANKDFLAGCNSNORMAL BZ#4758
  The rpPTANKDFLAGCNSNORMAL flag as been removed.

04/06/03 Pakfile example BZ#5104
  Changed the implementation of fexist in the pakfile example. Previously
  this was not overloaded and made the assumption that the default fexist
  would call it's overloaded pak fopen to test for existence. It now
  correctly looks up the file in the pak directory listing.

04/06/03 Exporters - Fix for bug 4860. GetRelativePath will now work
  regardless of case. Also moved GetRelativePath from RwRf3ExpTexture to
  shared\arttool\util\util.cpp opening use to other classes in future.

04/06/03 Collision Plugin Improvements (binary format change - 36001)
  The binary tree datastructure used by the collision plugin to extend
  an RpWorldSector or RpGeometry has been modified to improve efficiency
  of collision queries, streaming and memory usage. Older data is
  converted on stream read.

  A low level API has been created for constructing collision queries in a
  more flexible way, and to achieve better performance in many cases. This
  breaks down into

    - Iterator functions for stepping through world sectors intersecting
      a line or RwBBox. See RpSectorLineItInit etc.
    - Access to collision tree in a world sector or geometry using
      RpCollisionWorldSectorGetCollTree, RpCollisionGeometryGetCollTree.
    - Iterator functions for stepping through leaf nodes of a collision
      tree that intersect a line or RwBBox. The leaf nodes
      reference a slice of an external array of triangles.
      See RpCollSectorLineItInit etc.
    - Intersection tests using primitives (spheres, triangles etc)
      can be handled by RtIntsec toolkit, or user code.

  These stages operate independently, so they can easily be customized or
  overidden.

  The old API is still provided for compatibility but internally has been 
  re-implemented using the new iterators, and benefits from general 
  improvements in performance.

04/06/03 PI texture dictionary streaming (BZ#5048)
  Rasters are now created from the stored RwImages and attached
  to the RwTexture _before_ texture extension data is read.

04/06/03 Softras MatFX single UV transform (BZ#5092)
  The 2nd texture coordinate set was always selected to be transformed
  which may not exist.

03/06/03 Added bsp support to the toon editor

03/06/03 Xbox build machine upgraded to use the June 2003 SDK (#5558).

03/06/03 Xbox (BZ#5076) Skinning bug when using April 2003 XDK, fixed.

02/06/03 Exporters - Changed remapper to work properly with NULL shaders. 
  Added messages for when asset streamwrites fail. Added message for when 
  polygons have NULL shaders. Bug 4984 fix.

02/06/03 RenderWare Graphics Build tool
  Distclean option from the main menu updated to use the Win NULL target and
  visualc compiler. This is used to generate a minimal options.mak file to satisfy
  the build process. This change is to avoid possible conflicts with some
  compiler requirements.

30/05/03 Exporters - Change the remapper's vertex compare function to remap by
  the following criteria (in the specidied order):
  shader, ID, position, normal, uvs, color, pos index.

30/05/03 GCN(BZ#4266) Preloading textures now wait for the data to be uploaded
  before destroy the raster data.

30/05/03 GCN(BZ#3052) Modified raster palettes now get reloaded.

30/05/03 GCN (BZ#4027) The visualizer vertex count now uses GX_PERF1_VERTICES
  instead of GX_PERF0_VERTICES as this performance counter is not reliable.

29/05/03 Exporters - Asset Manager UI
  If an asset has a custom export file set then the file now displays as bold
  in the advanced settings asset manager tab. This makes it easier to determine
  which assets have custom export files set.

29/05/03 (BZ#4214) Added asserts to RwImageSetFromRaster and RwRasterSetFromImage
  if the raster is a compressed texture.

29/05/03 BZ#4649 Camera Clip Plane Asserts
  Changed the behavior of RenderWares asserts on the near clip plane being less
  than the far clip plane. Previously these asserts would fire during calls to
  the set clip plane functions, this could cause changing the default clip planes
  values to the required values to fire incorrect asserts. This would often 
  happen during RwCameraStreamRead. We now only assert that the clip planes are 
  valid prior to their use (during RwCameraBeginUpdate and RwCameraClear)

29/05/03 (BZ#5021) RwV3dTransformPoints & RwV3dTransformVectors now assert if the
  number of vertices is not greater than zero.

28/05/03 Exporters
   Two new functions have been added to RwExpMgrExportManager to allow users
   to preview the output files an asset will generate without actually exporting
   them. Both are called GetOutputFileNames(). One is passed a project template
   which will be parsed to determine the enabled output files and the other takes
   an RwCommExportOptions structure (and hence is faster).

27/05/03 Toon plugin. Added optimized render callbacks for a much faster
  silhouette rendering:
   RpXboxToonFastSilhouetteAtomicRenderCallback
   RpXboxToonFastSilhouetteWorldSectorRenderCallback
   RpD3D8ToonFastSilhouetteAtomicRenderCallback
   RpD3D8ToonFastSilhouetteWorldSectorRenderCallback
   RpD3D9ToonFastSilhouetteAtomicRenderCallback
   RpD3D9ToonFastSilhouetteWorldSectorRenderCallback
  These functions have to be set using RpAtomicSetRenderCallBack and
  RpWorldSetSectorRenderCallBack in order to work correctly.

27/05/03 Added exporter support for RwChunkGroup
  A new sub-option has been added to "Export RWS File" template option.
  When "Embed Group Chunks" is enabled the exporter will add
  RwChunkGroup chunks to the exported rws file. The group chunks will
  contain the names and GUIDs of the assets exported. The hierarchy of
  the groups will include the hierarchy of the assets (animation chunks
  will be in the group of the animated hierarchy they are children of).

  In order to implement this functionality the main RwCommExporter::Export
  function has changed so that it is now passed a structure containing export
  information (RwCommExportInfo). The RwExpStreamAsset class has also
  been changed so that it can store a hierarchy of assets.

27/05/03 Xbox (BZ#5034) RpTeam
  Fixed a bug when using rpHANIMHIERARCHYLOCALSPACEMATRICES or
  rpHANIMHIERARCHYNOMATRICES.

27/05/03 PC, 64-bit integer type for GCC compilers
  The RwInt64 and RwUInt64 types under GCC compilers for Win32 now
  alias to the 'long long' type.

27/05/03 RWSView example update
  Now uses a TOC, where available, to simplify asset loading,
  and a more sensible approach to HAnim management.

23/05/03 PS2 Response to Sony Tech note on FLUSHA hw bug
  As normally used RW should not trigger the bug, but this allows for all
  conditions.

23/05/03 RpUVAnim added
   UV Animation plugin added.

23/05/03 RtDict added
   Generic dictionary functionality toolkit added

22/05/03 OpenGL default renderstate updates:
   rwRENDERSTATEFOGDENSITY               = 1.0
   rwRENDERSTATESTENCILFUNCTIONMASK      = 0xFFFFFFFF
   rwRENDERSTATESTENCILFUNCTIONWRITEMASK = 0xFFFFFFFF
   rwRENDERSTATEALPHATESTFUNCTION        = rwALPHATESTFUNCTIONGREATER
    
22/05/03 Softras default renderstate updates:
   rwRENDERSTATEFOGDENSITY               = 1.0

22/05/03 PS2 Default cull mode changed to rwCULLMODECULLBACK.
  Default filter mode set to rwFILTERLINEAR.

22/05/03 GCN Default fog color changed from white to black.

21/05/03 Xbox (BZ #5012)
  Fixed bug with Matfx envmap not checking correctly the number available
  texture coordinates.

21/05/03 D3D (BZ #4843)
  Fixed bug when Multiple skins are attached to different nodes
  on the same hierarchy.

21/05/03 BZ#4592 PS2. When rendering a material using 8-bit textures A and B
  followed by a material using texture A the second material could be rendered
  with the pixels from texture A and the palette from texture B.

21/05/03 RwCore
  Rename RwGroup to RwChunkGroup. All other related names are also renamed.

20/05/03 RwCor
  Added new chunk IDS, rwID_GROUPBEGIN and rwID_GROUPEND.
  Added new core module, RwGroup, for supporting chunk identification in
  a binary stream.
  New RwGroup doc section in Streaming.

20/05/03 RpUserData streaming
  Fixed a problem where streaming of userdata could fail after a userdata
  array had been removed from an object.

20/05/03 BZ#4514 PDS. Post mesh callbacks can now be used in non metrics
  builds. All standard post mesh callbacks are now NULL in non metrics
  builds.

20/05/03 OpenExport
  A missing header file, RwObserver.h, has now been added to the build process.
  This is needed when including RwExpMgrTemplateManager.h.

19/05/03 Two new vector API functions have been added, RwV3dTransformVector
  and RwV3dTransformPoint.

19/05/03 (BZ#4400) Pre 0x30400 world loading code removed.

16/05/03 PS2 Projected texture pipelines added to PDS:
    rwPDS_G3_Prj_MatPipeID
    rwPDS_G3_SkinPrj_MatPipeID
    rwPDS_VCL_Prj_MatPipeID
    rwPDS_VCL_SkinPrj_MatPipeID
  When true clipping is enabled G3 projected texture pipelines must
  only be used to render onto geometry rendered with other G3 pipelines
  and VCL projected texture pipelines must only be used to render onto
  geometry rendered with other VCL pipelines.

16/05/03 RenderWare Graphics Base Version Change
  The Base Version supported by RenderWare Graphics has been
  increased to 3.40. This means that no data with a lower version
  will now stream into RenderWare. Older data should be converted
  with an older library. The version of stream data we now warn up to
  has also been increased to 3.50. All data prior to 3.50 will be
  subject to a warning during streaming because it may have
  performance implications. Please see the whitepaper on
  UpdatingYourRWGAssets for further details on RenderWare stream
  versioning.

16/05/03 RenderWare Graphics Build Tool
  Updated to sanity check the build environment to help identify
  incorrect compiler set up.

15/05/03 RwCore
  Added new chunk IDs, rwID_GROUPSTART and rwID_GROUPEND

15/05/03 GCN NBT Assembler now compiles under SN.

14/05/03 RwPalQuant
  The RenderWare palette quantization routines are now included as
  part of the standard RenderWare API. See the RwPalQuant section
  under Modules->Rasters, Textures & Images in the API ref for further
  details.

14/05/03 Toon
  Pre-instancing supported added for toon plugin on PS2 only.

13/05/03 Exports - Uncustomized Asset Mode (BZ #4600)
  When the the asset manager has not been put into customized
  mode the exporters now cache the GUIDs assigned to assets.
  Previously in uncustomized mode the GUIDs assigned to assets
  would change per export. GUID caching is now done based on the asset
  name and template type. If either of these changes between exports
  then GUIDs will also change. If persistent GUIDs must be guaranteed
  then customized asset mode should be used.

12/05/03 Spline Exporter (BZ #4583)
  Spline export has been changed so that the spline object created by
  RwExpRpSpline::BuildRpSpline is now added to the asset list by
  RwExpSplExporter::PostExport (rather than being added directly by
  RwExpRpSpline::BuildRpSpline).  This means that classes deriving from
  RwExpRpSpline can more easily modify the spline before it is added to
  the asset list.

12/05/03 Exporters
  The exporters no longer create any RenderWareAssets in the scene until
  the Advanced Settings window is displayed or an export/view operation
  is performed.

12/05/03 Maya Exporter (BZ #4875)
  When Maya automatically loads the RenderWare plugin because it detects
  a RenderWareAsset node in the scene being loaded we no longer lose
  the asset customization setting.

12/05/03 Exporters - Added "Export Object Name" option, which stores the
 original object's name as an RpUserData for each RenderWare object. Each
 RenderWare object type has an additional boolean option to enable/disable
 exporting the name for that type.

08/05/03 OpenGL state cache and multitexturing (BZ#4890)
  The OpenGL state cache was not handling multitextured enabled systems
  correctly. Additional state tokens have been introduced, for
  rwGL_TEXTUREn_2D, and rwGL_TEXTUREn_GEN_S|T|R|Q for n = 0,...,7.
  It is possible to use these in expressions, like the OpenGL API state
  values, e.g. rwGL_TEXTURE0_2D + RwOpenGLGetActiveTextureUnit() will
  select the appropriate GL_TEXTURE2D token for the currently active
  texture unit.
  Note that rwGL_TEXTURE_2D and rwGL_TEXTURE_GEN_S|T|R tokens have been
  removed.

08/05/03 Multiple calls to RpDMorphAtomicInitialize (BZ #4757)
  Added an assert on multiple calls to RpDMorphAtomicInitialize with the same
  atomic. This would result in the dmorph callback calling itself and hence
  causing stack overflow.

07/05/03 Rf3 Export (BZ #4826)
  Fixed bug that could lead to vertices being exported that did not
  match the vertexlist format.

07/05/03 Toon
  The toon plugin has been broken into 2 parts, a plugin RpToon and a toolkit
  RtToon.

  The following API functions have been renamed.

  RpToonGeoFindEdgeIndex          ->  RtToonGeoFindEdgeIndex
  RpToonWorldOptimize             ->  RtToonWorldOptimize
  RpToonGeoOptimizeEdgeInkIDs     ->  RtToonGeoOptimizeEdgeInkIDs
  RpToonGeoGetInkIDFromName       ->  RtToonGeoGetInkIDFromName
  RpToonGeoSetEdgeInkID           ->  RtToonGeoSetEdgeInkID
  RpToonGeoGetVertexRemap         ->  RtToonGeoGetVertexRemap
  RpToonGeoFindEdgeIndex          ->  RtToonGeoFindEdgeIndex
  RpToonGeometryCreateToonGeo     ->  RtToonGeometryCreateToonGeo
  RpToonWorldSectorCreateToonGeo  ->  RtToonWorldSectorCreateToonGeo
  RpToonGeoGetNumEdges            ->  RtToonGeoGetNumEdges

  RpToonGeoGetEdges               ->  RtToonGeoGetEdges
                                      It now also returns the address of the
                                      internal edge list instead of creating
                                      a copy.

07/05/03 Resource arena
  Changed allocation strategy to speed up orphan block operation.

07/05/03 Exporters - RW Shader (BZ #4800)
  Fixed problem that could lead to lockups when setting up RW Shader
  materials with the normal map and normal env maps set to the
  same texture.

06/05/03 PI texture dictionaries and auto mip generation
  PI texture dictionaries that contain textures with a single mip level but
  a mipped texture filter now have their PS rasters created with the
  rwRASTERFORMATAUTOMIPMAP flag set. This is useful for platforms that
  support mip generation in hardware.

06/05/03 GCN (BZ #4771)
  RxGameCubeVertexAttr, RxGameCubeVertexBuffer and RxGameCubeDisplayList
  documented.

06/05/03 OpenGL texture coordinate client states (BZ#4793)
  If rendering using a multitextured render callback was followed (not
  necessarily in the same frame) by rendering with a single texture unit
  render callback, some implementations of OpenGL would look for the
  second set of texture coordinates where none were available as the
  texture coordinate client state for unit 1 had not been disabled.
  This fix is to disable the appropriate texture coordinate client state
  when RwOpenGLSetTexture( NULL ) is called.

02/05/03 RtBMPImageWrite
  Now honours palettized images - it used to force everything to 24bpp

02/05/03 Texel based UV limiting
  Texel based UV limiting added to the exporter's uv limit filter.

01/05/03 3DS Max Exporter - Skylight Export (BZ #4789)
  Fixed exception when trying to export the Max 5 sky light type.

01/05/03 Memory allocation functions take memory hint.
  Following function take an extra parameter which is a memory hint:
    RwMalloc, RwRealloc, RwCalloc,
    RwFreeListCreate, RwFreeListCreateAndPreallocateSpace, RwFreeListAlloc
    rwSListCreate, rwSListGetNewEntry, rwSListGetNewEntries

  Hint is just an RwUInt32 which can take any combination of the following
  flags:
  enum RwMemoryHintFlag
  {
      rwMEMHINTFLAG_REALLOCATABLE  = 0x00010000
  };

  enum RwMemoryHintDuration
  {
      rwMEMHINTDUR_NADURATION = 0x0000,
      rwMEMHINTDUR_FUNCTION   = 0x0100,
      rwMEMHINTDUR_FRAME      = 0x0200,
      rwMEMHINTDUR_EVENT      = 0x0300,
      rwMEMHINTDUR_GLOBAL     = 0x0400,
  };

  and a RwCorePluginID, so typical call to RwMalloc might look like:
      RwMalloc (size, rwID_MATRIX | rwMEMHINTDUR_GLOBAL |
                rwMEMHINTFLAG_REALLOCATABLE);
  or if you don't care, just:
      RwMalloc (size, NULL);

  When you overload allocation function can use this hints to do memory
  management. Following macros are available available for extracting hint
  information:
      RwMemoryHintGetObjectID(hint)
      RwMemoryHintGetDuration(hint)
      RwMemoryHintGetFlags(hint)  
  

30/04/03 RpGeometryUnlock zero byte allocations (BZ #4790)
  Fixed a bug where creating a geometry with no triangles and no materials
  would allocate 3 zero byte blocks of memory.

29/04/03 Exporters (BZ #4798 & 4807)
  Fixed issue that could lead to incorrect lightmap generation on worlds and
  hierarchies that have non-identity world transforms.

28/04/03 Maya exporter (BZ #4801)
  The RenderWareAutoCreateAsset and RenderWareAutoCreateAssets MEL commands
  now return the names of asset nodes created.

28/04/03 PS2All pipeline bug (BZ#4809). The PS2All pipeline could reinstance
  due to the data in the resource header being incorrectly set when the
  resource header was created.

28/04/03 Exporter UI
  An extra column has been added to the asset manager interface. This column
  previews the file the asset will generate on export. A browse button allows
  the export file to be customized per asset. This functionality replaces the
  custom export file controls which were added to the per-asset dialogs.
  These changes affect the Export Manager API and so the RwComm version
  number has been incremented.

28/04/03  RF3 Split By Asset Bugfix (BZ #4496)
  When exporting animated hierarchy/animation pairs to split RF3 files the
  animation RF3 now correctly contains asset information.
 
24/04/03 Xbox build machine using April 2003 XDK with Integrated Hotfixes
  (#5455.2).

24/04/03 Tutorial 7 (BZ #4721)
  TOC had been stripped from .rws files 

24/04/03 rt2d (BZ #4741) Rt2dSceneLock leaks when called on a locked scene
  Fixed

23/04/03 Exporter Asset Manager Peformance (BZ #4742)
  The redraw performance of the asset manager tab of the advanced settings
  window has been improved. This is particularly noticeable on scenes
  containing many hundreds of assets.

23/04/03 Alpha test support.
  Basic alpha test support. For more complex support, use the platform
  specific render state.
  RwRenderState rwRENDERSTATEALPHATESTFUNCTION sets function from
  RwAlphaTestFunction type. Reference value is set using RwRenderState
  rwRENDERSTATEALPHATESTFUNCTIONREF as an integer between 0-255 scaled to
  the platform's normal range.

22/04/03 Exporter Traverse Order (BZ #3429)
  A new option has been added to the animated hierarchy asset template that
  allows the user to control how transforms are traversed.  By setting traversal
  order to by name or by tag id it is now possible to guarantee that animations
  exported from duplicated hierarchies will be interchangeable.

22/04/03 PS2 (BZ#4524) Fixed color clamping bug in the PDS Cloning pipelines

22/04/03 Xbox (BZ#4650) Added function RpXboxPixelShaderSetFreeListCreateParams.

22/04/03 3ds max exporter script interface (BZ #4689)
  The RenderWare_Exporter.AssetMgr.CreateAsset() script function now returns
  the INode created rather than the baseObject.

22/04/03 GCN (BZ#4577) Environment map scaling
  The environment matrix is orthonormalized to prevent texture wrapping if the
  matrix has scaling in it.

22/04/03 3ds max and Maya Exporters
  Added Japanese specific behaviour and text to the exception handler.

17/04/03 Skeleton maxFPS
  The unused RsGlobal member maxFPS has been removed, this was used in
  the past for frame limiting but is now obsolete. All shipped examples,
  viewers and demos have been updated to take account of this.

17/04/03 RtTOC (BZ#4652) 
  RtTOC stream read functions were doing endian conversion twice which
  would've resulted in incorrect TOC data on big endian machines.

17/04/03 RtTOC (BZ#4648) 
  RtTOC stream writing could previously have crashed in the case of a
  failure to write data into the given stream. The function will now
  correctly return a NULL result

16/04/03 OpenGL toon (BZ#4688)
  Toon pipelines did not contain the correct plugin Id.

15/04/03 Exporters
  Fixed problem that could lead to "Unable to set object frame to:" messages
  and aborted exports when exporting Static World assets with the 3ds max
  or Maya scene start time set to > 0.

15/04/03 PS2 RpPDS (BZ#4463)
  rwPDS_G3_Toon_MatPipeID pipeline now sets GS_ZBUF_2 register

15/04/03 RwCore
  rwLIBRARYCURRENTVERSION set to 0x36000.

15/04/03  Added RwCameraForAllAtomicsInFrustum().

15/04/03 Camera no longer RwFree()s sectorList when its removed from a world, the
element count is simply reset.  Avoids RwMalloc/RwFree each time a camera is added
and rmoved from a world.

15/04/03 PS2 PDS Skinned shadow rendering pipeline added. This untextured unlit 
  pipeline allows fast rendering of skinned objects into shadow textures.
  PDS ids: rwPDS_G3x_SkinShd_AtmPipeID rwPDS_G3x_SkinShd_MatPipeID.

14/04/03 PS2 Examples
  Updated vcproj example projects to build properly.

13/04/03 RF3 Export
  Fixed bug introduced on 03/04/03. When exporting animated hierarchy assets
  with animation children the animated hierarchy asset is no longer incorrectly
  disabled.

13/04/03 Exporters - Added support for per-asset export files
  A new option has been added to the per-asset dialogs. The custom
  export file option allows the artist to override the normal export
  location rules used by the exporter. The export file type is still
  controlled exclusively by the project template in use. If multiple
  assets point to the same export file they will be merged into a single
  file.

  When upgrading pre 3.5 scenes that have assets pointing to multiple
  directories this information is now correctly preserved.

  Because this change adds a new parameter to RwCommAsset the RwComm and
  RF3 version numbers have been incremented. There have also been
  significant changes within the RwExpMgrExportManager class.

11/04/03 Maya Exporter- Fixed a bug in auto create code.
  There was uninitialized variable that could lead to auto create code
  not behaving properly. Fixed now.

11/04/03 Xbox (BZ#4631) pixel shader constants don't always get uploaded, fixed.

10/04/03 (BZ#4596) rpmatfx: second matrix doens't get applied, fixed.

10/04/03 Exporters
  A new option has also been added to the Normal Map section of the RenderWare
  Material in 3dsmax and Maya. The Modulate Env Map option controls whether
  the environment map is modulated by the base texture color.

10/04/03 Exporters
  The RenderWare material normal map options have been moved out of the
  Xbox specific section and moved to a new Normal Map section. These options
  are now supported on D3D9 as well as Xbox.

10/04/03 Exporters
  Fixed a bug that could lead to Lightmap, Normal Map and Toon RenderWare
  material settings not being correctly read from RF3 files.

10/04/03 GCN Visualizer
  Added GCN broadband adapter support

10/04/03 Rt2d
  Removed old Rt2dFontCacheFlush.
  Added Rt2dFontIsOutline.
  Changed font binary file format to include internal ver stamp.

10/04/03 Support for 2D particle rotation in Max
  Added support for exporting 2D particle rotation for renderware
  particles in 3dsmax.

10/04/03 Build tool (BZ#4590)
  The cwsky compiler was incorrectly reporting error contexts since there
  was no compiler context resource set up, and the build tool was using the
  default search term 'error' which occurred as part of the compiler options.

  Solution was to add a specific cwsky compiler context resource.
  Further information has been added to the documentation regarding this
  problem and solution.

09/04/03 PS2 (BZ#4560)
  Fixed a bug in the material effects pipelines where filling the dma
  unreference array would close the dma buffer before the packet had
  been completely written.

08/04/03 Xbox build machine upgraded to use the April 2003 SDK (#5455).

08/04/03 RenderWare Graphics DLL
  Naming convention change from rwg.dll to rwg<RWTARGET>.dll.

07/04/03 Support for 2D particle rotation in Maya
  Added support for exporting 2D particle rotation for renderware
  particles in maya.

07/04/03 PS2 (BZ#4524)
  Fixed colour clamping in the G3x_ADLClone pipeline

03/04/03 .anm exporting from Rf3 files
  added support for exporting indivdual anm assets from Rf3 by adding the parent 
  asset as disabled to the Rf3 file.

03/04/03 Disabling of assets in Rf3 files
  Added a param to the Rf3 format for disabling and enabling of individual
  assets within an Rf3 file.

03/04/03 Exporter UV transform (BZ#4516)
  A bug has been fixed that could lead to inconsistent UV values when using
  multiple textures with differing addressing modes on a single mesh.

03/04/03 Softras Im2D fogging (BZ#4531)
  Now supports Im2D fogging.

03/04/03 RpTeam
  Added generic RpTeamMaterialSetPlayerColor and RpTeamMaterialGetPlayerColor
  These define player specific material colors used whilst rendering.
  
03/04/03 OpenGL Im2D fogging (BZ#4531)
  Now fully supports Im2D fogging and not just when z-writes or z-tests were
  enabled.

02/04/03 Xbox (BZ#4532) Lightmap plugin
  Fixed a bug when a base texture has alpha channel.

02/04/03 Maya Exporter
  Fixed bug that meant lightmapping flags would not always be exported
  correctly from RenderWareShader materials in Maya scenes.

02/04/03 Exporters
  Fixed bug that could cause an exception in 3ds max or Maya when exporting a
  RenderWare Shader material shared across multiple objects to an RF3 file.

02/04/03 OpenGL state changes
  To avoid redundant glEnable/glDisable calls, and avoid querying the server
  with glIsEnabled, the RenderWare Graphics OpenGL core has been extended
  with three new functions:
    RwOpenGLEnable (equivalent to glEnable)
    RwOpenGLDisable (equivalent to glDisable)
    RwOpenGLIsEnabled (equivalent to glIsEnabled)
  An enumeration, RwOpenGLStateToken, details the OpenGL states that may be
  used. These functions cache the current state and are exposed as macros in
  release builds.

  The following functions have been removed from the world plugin as their
  usage is now integral in the above extensions:
    RpOpenGLWorldDisableColorMaterial
    RpOpenGLWorldDisableLighting
    RpOpenGLWorldDisableNormalize
    RpOpenGLWorldEnableLighting
    RpOpenGLWorldEnableNormalize
    RpOpenGLWorldIsLightingEnabled

31/03/03 Xbox (BZ#4511) Skin Toon plugin now supports less than 4 weights per
  vertex.

28/03/03 RF3 Export
  A bug that meant asset names could sometimes be changed when exported to
  RF3 files has been fixed. The fix involves changes to the RF3 format and
  the RwMI layer so the RF3 and RwComm version numbers have been incremented.

27/03/03 PS2 Driver
  Replaced all u_long128 types with RwUInt128

26/03/03 RtLtMap
  Changed the way each lighting session is controlled. It is now uses objects,
  world sectors or atomics, as the start and duration of each illumination
  slice, rather than samples.
  startSample and numSamples has been replaced by startObj and numObj in
  the session structure.
  Progress report has also been changed to report back 0%-100% for the
  current lighting session, rather a percentage of total samples to be
  lit.
  Fixed minor error in RtLightMapIlluminate. Now returns RwInt32 rather than
  RwUInt32.

25/03/03 GCN Compressed vertex positions and world sectors.
  When using compressed vertex formats for positions in worlds the world
  sectors positions will now be treated as though they are relative to the
  infimum vertex of the world sectors tight bounding box. This allows large
  worlds to use compressed vertex positions with out running out of range.

25/03/03 PS2 (BZ#4437) - user set alpha blending being overwritten by 
  instancing.
  RpPTankAtomicSkyRenderStateSet now unset rpPTANKIFLAGALPHABLENDING in the 
  instance flags.

21/03/03 Visualizer Fixed bug loading large palettized textures on PS2

20/03/03
  Added rtLTMAPMATERIALVERTEXLIGHT to material to allow some materials to be
  illuminated with vertex lighting

20/03/03 RpPrtAdv & RpPrtStd
  Fixed problem with multiple properties in prtadv. It is now possible to
  have several property tables which have the same set of properties but
  different number of frames in the multi frame props. 
  Added new API
    RpPrtStdPropTabGetByProperties
    RpPrtStdEClassGetByPropTab
    RpPrtStdPClassGetByPropTab

20/03/03 Exporter Licensing Problems
  Fixed an issue where it was possible to find an incorrect version of the
  licensing dll on the path prior to the one installed by RenderWare. This
  could cause the exporters to fail to request a valid license. We now
  explicitly load the installed dll instead of relying upon the path being
  setup.

20/03/03 RtBMP 32 bit support
  Added support for loading 32 bit RGB color BMPs, it's unclear
  whether these are valid in the BMP format without extended Bitmap headers
  specifying bit masks. However support was implemented by fixing
  a hard coded 3 byte per pixel scanline malloc which also has the benefit
  of reducing memory overhead for 4 and 8 bit Bitmap reading.

18/03/03 GCN ptank
  Fixed SN build errors.

18/03/03 GCN (BZ#4336)
  Single weight toon shaded geometry is now supported.

17/03/03 Maestro
  Fixed a problem whereby undisplayed sprite animations could run in the
  background, possibly influencing the sequencing of foreground animations

17/03/03 OpenGL NVIDIA Vertex Array Range 2 initialization (BZ#4356)
  The GL_VERTEX_ARRAY_RANGE_WITHOUT_FLUSH_NV client state token should be
  enabled/disabled within the GL_VERTEX_ARRAY_RANGE_NV state rather than
  exclusively to it.

17/03/03 Visualizer - fixed 'No RpHAnim Matrices' set bug (BZ#4199)

17/03/03 OpenGL
  Following internal-use function prototypes removed from rwcore.h:
    _rwOpenGLIm2DOpen
    _rwOpenGLIm2DClose
    _rwOpenGLIm2DSetSubmitFuncs
    _rwOpenGLIm2DSetVertexFuncs
    _rwOpenGLSetInitialRenderState
    _rwOpenGLSetRenderState
    _rwOpenGLGetRenderState

14/03/03 RwFrameListSetAutoUpdate(RwBool) allows disabling
  FrameListStreamRead from adding to dirtyList. This is useful when
  performing asyncronous reading.

13/03/03 RpWorldCreate 0-size mallocs removed (BZ#4245)

13/03/03 Xbox (BZ#4234)
  Controller 1 ignored if there was another controller in port 3 or 4, fixed.

13/03/03 OpenGL RwRasterClearRect BZ#4320
  Fixed an issue that would repeat the cleared rectangle across the raster in
  some cases.

13/03/03 Rt2d
  Added support for font streaming. New APIs are added for this.
      Rt2dFontStreamRead
      Rt2dFontStreamWrite
      Rt2dFontStreamGetSize
  Texture dictionary is now used for bitmap fonts. New APIs for setting and
  query the font's texture dictionary.
      Rt2dFontTexDictionaryGet
      Rt2dFontTexDictionarySet     

13/03/03 png loading bugfix (BZ#4309)
  pngs specifying a greater palette size than the bit depth allowed were
  crashing the png read function. Fixed.

12/03/03 3ds max Exporter - Max script functions.
  A new interface with three functions is added. They are:
	RenderWare_Exporter.AssetMgr.CreateAsset();
	RenderWare_Exporter.AssetMgr.AutoCreateAssets();
	RenderWare_Exporter.AssetMgr.SetCustomizedAssets(bool bCustomized);
  The first function works with selection and returns new asset object. If
  nothing is selected Static World asset is created. You can query object
  properties with:
	objAsset=RenderWare_Exporter.AssetMgr.CreateAsset()
	showProperties objAsset
  The second function will analyse the entire scene and create the assets.
  The third function will set the Customized flag. If set to true, users are
  responsible for managing asset, where if set to false, assets will be
  recreated automatically on each export.

12/03/03 OpenGL RwOpenGLVASetPosition(ATI) (BZ#4310)
  RwOpenGLVASetPosition and RwOpenGLVASetPositionATI did not update the
  client state cache when called, causing redundant calls to
  glEnableClientState.

07/03/03 OpenGL display list prelight + material color modulation (BZ#4273)
  Modulated color values were incorrect for display list instancing.

04/03/03 XBox (BZ#4244)
  The driver now sets automatically the required renderstates for antialiasing.

04/03/03 PS2 Multipass rendering. Fixed bug with NULL texture causing
  subsequent textured meshes to be incorrectly rendered. (BZ#3147)

04/03/03 OpenGL NVIDIA vertex array range & remapped vertex data (BZ#4222)
  Atomics that have numIndices < numVertices can now be remapped at instance
  to reduce the number of vertices in vertex arrays. Display lists do not
  support remapping.

  NVIDIA vertex array range (VAR) memory manager updated to dynamically adjust
  the VAR pool size if heavy use of dynamic vertex arrays is detected.

28/02/03 GCN (BZ#4233)
  In a rare case the Async rendering code could wake a thread before it was
  slept causeing the ASync rendering code to lockup.

27/02/03 RtLtMap
  Fixed segv from reloading a lightmap world and regenerating the lightmaps.

25/02/03 22:00:00
  RW35Active branch created.

24/02/03 XBox visualizer
  Corrected controller drift problem (BZ#4137)

24/02/03 PS2 DebugStation Visualizer
  Now spins down DVD after loading Visualizer

20/02/03 RpPatchMesh streaming. (BZ#2994)
  RpPatchMesh stream write now wraps the patch mesh in a rwID_PATCHMESH chunk.
  Hence when streaming in an RpPatchMesh with RpPatchMeshStreamRead the 
  rwID_PATCHMESH must be found first. If old functionality is required use
  the stealth function _rpPatchMeshStreamReadNoChunk.

20/02/03 RpPTank
  All platforms: fixed 2d and matrix particle rotation to correctly calculate
  particle orientation with respect to up vector being 0 degrees.
  GCN: fixed constant centre offset to machine the offset space of the generic
  platform.

19/02/03 PS2 PS2All
  Modified RpMeshPS2AllSyncTextureUpload to always enable or disable alpha
  test. Hence also modified RpMeshPS2AllTextureStateUpload to always set
  the GS_TEST_1 register.

19/02/03 GCN
  Changed dlFwrite to return the number of items written.

19/02/03 Exporters - Removed bounding box influence on the exported world.
  The RtImportWorld now calcualtes its own bounding box, according to the
  given geometry, and igonres the bounding box of the exported scene. In 3.4,
  exporting a sub set of the world, would result in a big bounding box binding
  the entire scene. In 3.5, only the sub set's box is calculated.

19/02/03 RenderWare mesh building
  Changed the way in which triangle data is sorted for mesh building. This
  previously involved some sorting based on pointer address meaning that
  matching vertex and triangle input data didn't guarantee the same output.
  This has now been resolved.

19/02/03 Xbox build machine using February 2003 XDK with Integrated Hotfixes
  (#5344.2).

18/02/03 GCN
  Fixed asserts in RpGeometryDestroy due to reference count being decremented
  to early.

18/02/03 GCN Patch2
  Build machine upgraded to use GCN_SDK_5-Sept-2002_Patch2.

15/02/03 Rt2d / Maestro - Fixed color tints problem (BZ#3356)
  rt2d's color hierarchical scale/offset has been fixed
  Color tint offsets are now correctly exported by 2dconvrt.

14/02/03 Exporter - RwCommMesh::GetTriangleUserData function is removed.
  Instead you should use GetPrimitiveUserData() and RwExpPrimToTriMap()
  functions.

14/02/03 Memory clean up on stream read failures (BZ#3985 + BZ#3991)
  Fixed some memory leaks when RpClumpStreamRead fails during the streaming
  of a clump.

13/02/03 OpenGL Ptank metrics (BZ#3951)
  NumProcTriangles were showing an incorrect value.

12/02/03 GCN New API functions.
  RxGameCubePreInstanceSetOptimize
  RxGameCubePreInstanceGetOptimize
  RwGameCubeSetFrameLatency
  RwGameCubeSetMinRetraceCount

12/02/03 3ds max Exporter - Scale Keys now extracted from PRS controllers
  The RwMaxPRSControlCreator::TraverseControllers function now builds
  animations from the scale sub controller. If you have used large numbers
  of scale only keys this could lead to redundant keyframes being exported so
  we recommend removing unnecessary scale keys.

12/02/03 PowerPipe BZ#3371
  Fixed bug in calculating node index in RxPipelineFindNodeByName

12/02/03 Maya Material Alpha. 
  Previously (3.4) The Alpha value for a Maya material
  was taken from the Alpha gain value of any diffuse colour texture map. 
  This is not how the material alpha works in the Maya viewport. Have changed
  Maya materials to always take the alpha value of the base material colour. 
  The Exporter will display a warning message if any diffuse texture with non 
  standard (1.0) Alpha Gain is detected. 
    
11/02/03 3ds max Exporter - RwMaterial and Render To Texture (RTT)
  All the images rendered from the RTT for object with RwMaterial, were black.
  This is now fixed for all render elements except complete and specular maps.
  Currently diffuse map renders only unshaded and normal map doesn't include
  the RwMaterial bump map perturbations.

11/02/03 Xbox build machine upgraded to use .Net compiler and February 2003
  SDK (#5344).

11/02/03 RtLtMap (BZ#3955)
  RtLtMap now depends on RpRandom. All calls to rand have been replaced with
  calls to RpRandom.

11/02/03 Instance
  Skin-splitting is now done in the custom instancers. This assumes reasonable
  defaults for each platform, but source is provided so you may modify these
  if desired.

11/02/03 RpLtMap & RtLtMap
  Redone lightmap supersampling slightly. Supersampling is now selected during
  illumination with RtLtMapIlluminate, rather than during creation stage with
  RtLtMapLightMapsCreation.
  Also removed the tmp image per texture to just one tmp image. This image is
  reused for each lightmap to reduce memory usage.

11/02/03 RpPTank BZ#3845
  Fixed a bug which was breaking alpha rendering in PTank release builds.

11/02/03 3ds max Exporter - Custom Attributes
  There was a bug with vertex and face custom attributes exported as our user
  data. Fixed now.

10/02/03 Softras installer now requires that the same build version of 
  RW 3.5 PC exists on the same machine, installed as the same user.

10/02/03 OpenGL MatFX multipass environment map & fog BZ#3926
  If fogging was enabled, multipass environment mapping applied fog in
  both passes.

10/02/03 Softras MCP project files updated (demos, examples, viewers)
  Now requires CodeWarrior 8.3 for Windows.

10/02/03 OpenGL MatFX environment mapping optimization
  Further to the changelog entry on 10/10/02, a further requirement to use the
  multitexturing optimization for environment mapping is that fogging is
  disabled.

08/02/03 Examples - GCond
  Added GCond Example.

07/02/03 GCN
  All CodeWarrior MCP files have been repaired and upgraded to CodeWarrior(R)
  for GAMECUBE, Release 2.0

07/02/03 RtWorldImportParams
  Changed the functionality of RtWorldImportParametersInit. The parameters
  are now owned by the caller and therefore should be static.

07/02/03 RWSView example added
  Illustrates how to load assets from an .rws file into a RenderWare Graphics
  application. The .rws file supplied contains a world, a platform independent
  texture dictionary, two clumps and two animations.

07/02/03 TOC
  RtTOCCreate no longer recurses into complex chunks.

06/02/03 Imshadow example modifications (fixes BZ#3814)
  Changes have been made to the way the imshadow shadow render function
  decides if fading should be enabled. It is now explicitly passed as a 
  parameter rather than being implied by a fade distance.

06/02/03 RpLtMap & RtLtMap
  Introduced supersampling to lighmap generations. Sampling can now be done
  at a higher resolution before downsampling to a lower resolution for
  display. The functions, RtLtMapLightMapCreate has been changed to include an
  extra parameter to specify the supersampling value.
  Changed the functionality of the lightmap clearing functions. This
  previously would clear the lightmap display texture and create the lightmap
  sample image. This has been changed to just clearing the lightmap display
  texture. The lightmap sample image is created seperately.

05/02/03 Partition Visualisation
  Added CreateAssetPartitionObject() API function to the RwExpMgrExportManager
  class and CreatePartitionObject( ), RemovePartitionObject( ) API functions
  to RwCommAsset class. All the control of the partition visualization objects
  in the modelling package.

05/02/03 Preinstancing tool
  Can now filter default connections by platform

05/02/03 PS2 Camera textures
  Subrastering of camera textures now works.

04/02/03 RwPlCore
  Added rwLIBRARYWARNVERSION. This marks the version and below that will
  produce warning messages when old binary data are read in. The file is still
  read in but will produce messages to recommend the file be re-exported.

04/02/03 Exporters - Bug fix for exporting toon data.
  There was a bug when exporting bsp toon scene. User specified crease edges
  were not remapped right. Fixed now.

04/02/03 3ds max Exporter - Utility renamed and interface change.
  Our utility in 3ds max is renamed from RenderWare_Batch_Exporter to
  RenderWare_Exporter, so a typical call to it would be like:
  RenderWare_Exporter.Interface.Advanced_Settings()
  Currently exposed functions through this interface are:
  Export, View, Advanced_Settings, Plugin_Information, Help_Reference_Guide,
  Help_Tutorials, Help_Programmer and Tools_BatchExport.

04/02/03 GCN (BZ#3784) lib prefix
  lib prefix removed from SN built libs and makefiles.

03/02/03 Exporters
  Changed UV limiting to allow floating point values.

03/02/03 Win (D3D8 and OpenGL) MCP project files updated (demos, examples,
  viewers) Now requires CodeWarrior 8.3 for Windows.

03/02/03 Tutorial 6 added
  A new tutorial expanding the use of RWS files and TOCs.

31/01/03 GCN pathclibsetjmp
  It is no longer required to patch rtpng.a using pathclibsetjmp when linking
  CodeWarrior built libs with SN.

31/01/03 (BZ#3649) PITexDicts and texture plugin data
  Platform independent texture dictionaries did not stream texture plugin
  extension data.
  The internal format of PItexdicts has been changed to accomodate plugin
  data. A legacy code path for stream reading existing PItexdicts is provided.
  Note that plugins that have extension data in the PItexdicts must now be
  attached before stream reading the PItexdicts.

30/01/03 (BZ#2951) importing sectors in PVSEdit from xml and kd files is
  different. removed kd support from PVSEdit since it is not compatible with
  pvs data.

30/01/03 (BZ#3749) PVSEdit edit->undo option does nothing
  Removed the edit menu.

30/01/03 (BZ#2836) PVSEdit doesn't refresh the view immediately
  Viewport refresh bug fixed in PVSEdit.

30/01/03 (BZ#3329) Toon Editor does not support RWS files
  Toon editor now supports Animated Hierarcy assets and textures from within
  RWS files.

30/01/03 PS2 New metric
  ExtraPassNumTriangles added to measure the number of extra triangles
  processed by multi-pass rendering. Toon, matfx and lightmap pipelines all
  support this new metric.

30/01/03 RpLtMap and RtLtMap
  Changed the way darkmaps are generated. The darkmap conversion is no longer
  an automatic operation and no longer limited to PlayStation 2 only. Darkmap
  conversion can now be done on a host, PC, for use on a PlayStation 2 without
  requiring a NULLSKY build.
  The lightmap example can now generate and view a lightmap result, convert to
  a darkmap and saved as PI tex dict for used on a PlayStation 2. The output
  texture dictionary now contains both the base textures and the lightmap
  textures.

30/01/03 GCN
  The following code is no longer needed when linking CodeWarrior built
  RenderWare Graphics libraries with SN.

  #if (defined(__SN__))
  RwInt32 __float_nan[]   =   {0x7FFFFFFF};
  RwInt32 __float_huge[]  =   {0x7f800000};
  #endif /* (defined(__SN__)) */

30/01/03 Exporters - Function renaming
  Fallowing functions are renamed from: AddShapeVerticesToRtImportWorld,
  AddShapeFacesToRtImportWorld, to: AddShapeVerticesToRtWorldImport,
  AddShapeFacesToRtWorldImport.

29/01/03 preinstancer (BZ#2111)
  instance now always renames output with platform-specific extension.
  instance now has an option to search for and include textures/anims prior
  to instancing, making it possible to view the instanced file with textures
  and animations on the platform-specific visualizers

29/01/03 Exporter and (BZ#2189)
  Changed the way vertex welding works - it now truly welds polygons, not
  just snap them to a grid. In addition, there are two extra control params
  to say what exactly permits welding.

29/01/03 PS2 MatFX (BZ#3351) Texture uploads.
  In some rare cases the second pass texture was ejecting the first even
  though the texture cache was large enough for both textures.

28/01/03 Exporters - Changes to the RwCommObjCreator
  RwCommObjCreator::Attach() now takes one more parameter, which is
  RwCommCreationData. All derived class will have to be updated.

28/01/03 GCN (BZ#3085)
  NBT generation now works with pre-instanced data.

28/01/03 GCN RwGameCubeSetAlphaCompare
  RwGameCubeSetAlphaCompare API function added for setting alpha compare
  parameters.

28/01/03 GCN GXSetZCompLoc
  Now has an internal function _rwDlRenderStateSetZCompLoc for setting
  GXSetZCompLoc. All calls to GXSetZCompLoc should be changed to use
  _rwDlRenderStateSetZCompLoc in order to keep cache coherency.

28/01/03 GCN GXSetAlphaCompare
  GXSetAlphaCompare in no longer called by any rendering pipelines.

  alphaComp, alphaCompRef0 & alphaCompRef01 have been removed from
  _rwDlStateCache.

28/01/03 (BZ#2111) Instance tool:
  - Instance always renames output extensions to match target platform.
    Previously this was done for .rws files, now all RW files are renamed.

28/01/03 OpenGL: Removal of exposed #defines in rwcore.h
  - COLOUR_SCALAR removed as it was unused
  - rwOGLNEARSCREENZ and rwOGLGLFARSCREENZ moved to internal use only.

28/01/03 GCN Upgraded build machine to use,
  CodeWarrior(R) for GAMECUBE, Release 2.0

28/01/03 GCN Upgraded build machine to use,
  GCN_SDK_5-Sept-2002_Patch1.

27/01/03 (BZ#3706) OpenGL texdicts and non-mipmapped textures
  Non-mipmapped textures in an OpenGL texdict were read in as mipmapped.

27/01/03 PS2 MatFX Changes to second and third pass renderstates.
  New API functions RpMatFXSkyRenderStateSet/Get have been added to allow the
  ALPHA, FOGCOL and TEST register values to be set for environment map, dual
  pass and dual pass uv transform effects. These effects now use the use the
  global z write and z test render states and the clamp and filtering settings
  from the texture.

27/01/03 Removed item: 07/01/03 Win32 skeleton menu FPS limiter

23/01/03 MatFX UVANIM effects renamed to UVTRANSFORM
  rpMATFXEFFECTUVANIM is now rpMATFXEFFECTUVTRANSFORM
  rpMATFXEFFECTDUALUVANIM is now rpMATFXEFFECTDUALUVTRANSFORM
  RpMatFXMaterialSet/GetUVAnimTransforms are now
	RpMatFXMaterialSet/GetUVTransformMatrices

23/01/03 Baseball demo (BZ#3647)
  Crowds changed so that only one crowd (daytime or nighttime) is instanced
  during the lifetime of the demo.

22/01/03 OpenGL environment mapping frame (BZ#3625)
  The envmap was incorrectly positioned.

22/01/03 GCN The environment variable CWFOLDER is no longer used to specify
  the CodeWarrior directory. The registry is now used to find the correct
  path. IF GCNCWFOLDER is defined then this path will be used instead.

22/01/03 GCN The environment variable DOLPHINSDK is no needed to build
  RenderWare graphics for GameCube. All makefiles now use the DOLPHIN_ROOT
  environment variable that is set when installing the DolphinSDK. If
  DOLPHINSDK is defined then this path will be used instead of the one
  specified by DOLPHIN_ROOT.

21/01/03 RwTextureSetMipmapping API Reference
  Updated the API reference to include information about loading textures from
  inside stream read functions.  The behaviour of this API remains unchanged.

21/01/03 GCN BZ#3619 Im2d & pixel accuracy
  Im2d was not correctly calculating the projection matrix leading to
  triangles not hitting the correct pixels.

21/01/03 GCN BZ#3623 Im2D & Scissor rect
  2D Immedaite mode no longer sets the scissor rectangle. It now relies on
  RwCameraBeginUpdate setting it to the rasters rectangle. This allows the
  user to change the scissor rectangle between 2D renders.

21/01/03 PS2 - skeleton - CW
  Added call to CW C++ support code whenever the skeleton is compiled as c++
  and/or when using a product that would need it.

16/01/03 GCN BZ#3403
  Tokens above 0xE000 are now ignored to prevent conflict with the PERF
  library.

16/01/03 GCN BZ#3287
  When seeking to the end of a file from the start dlFseek would try to
  read 0 bytes from the end of the file causing DVDRead to fail.

16/01/03 NULL target DLL generation
  When building the NULL RenderWare Graphics SDK with RWDLL=1, the compiler is
  now set up to build with the /MD[d] flag (multithreaded DLL).

16/01/03 GCN RwGameCubeMinRetraceCountSet
  RwGameCubeMinRetraceCountSet has been added.

15/01/03 PS2 rwDMA_flipData
  rwDMA_flipData type now has slots for a pair of extra display environments
  used in the same way as the 4 dma pointers

15/01/03 RwCameraForAllClumpsNotInFrustum removed from API
  This somewhat obsolete function has been removed since it has great
  potential for confusion in that it relies on RwCameraForAllClumpsInFrustum
  being called first. Also, its behaviour is simple to reproduce using
  RwCameraForAllClumpsInFrustum to mark clumps in the frustum, and then
  using RpWorldForAllClumps to iterate through all clumps, and acting on those
  that have not been marked.

15/01/03 RpWorldGetOrigin removed from API
  This functionality is no longer required since all worlds generated by
  RenderWare since RenderWare 3.10 have a fixed origin of 0,0,0.

15/01/03 RtLtMap
  Added new functions to select and replace the luminance calculation function
  during texture processing on the PS2.
  The set of new functions and callbacks are
    RtLtMapSkyLumCalcMaxCallBack
    RtLtMapSkyLumCalcSigmaCallBack
    RtLtMapSkySetLumCalcCallBack
    RtLtMapSkyGetLumCalcCallBack

14/01/03 RenderWare Graphics Build Tool - Exporters
  Support to build the exporters have been removed since their build process
  now works through DSPs rather than makefiles.

14/01/03 BZ#3379 - 2D toolkit.
2dString and Scene streaming are now endianess proof.

13/01/03 RtImport geometry conditioning.
  Moved to separate toolkits: rtgeomcond and rtwing.
  This affected RtImport, RtGCond, RtWing, RtBary, exporters, world example,
  sector editor and pvs editor. Directly affected are RtImport's conditioning
  parameters and the way Geometry Conditioning is handled.

10/01/03 GCN RxGameCubeResEntryHeader & RxGameCubeInstanceData

  RxGameCubeResEntryHeader & RxGameCubeInstanceData have been removed and
  replaced with RxGameCubeVertexBuffer & RxGameCubeDisplayList.
  RxGameCubeVertexAttr has been added.

10/01/03 GCN Instance & Pre-instance

  Pre-instancing now takes advantage of an index per attribute and variable
  length attribute arrays.

  Pre-instancing removes degenerate triangles from tristrips.

  The above pre-instancing optimisations work with static and skinned geometry
  only. Geometry with NBTs will currently not be optimized.

  IMPORTANT: The native Pre-instance format has been broken and all
  pre-instanced assets will need to be regenerated.

10/01/03 GCN NBT Generation
  NBT generation now works with compressed vertex formats.

10/01/03 BZ#3382 - BZ#3384 - PTank PS2.
  Default alpha testing mode is now the same as the for the rest of RenderWare
  Added platform specfic functions RpPTankAtomicSkyRenderStateSet
  and RpPTankAtomicSkyRenderStateGet, to access and modify the alpha and the
  test register.

10/01/03 GCN NBT Generation
  Pre-instanced vertex data can now optionally by heavily optimized to remove
  duplicate vertex attributes and degenerate triangles from tri strips.

10/01/03 GCN NBT Generation
  NBT generation now works with compressed vertex formats.

08/01/03 PS2 Skin - BZ#3441
  Pre-instance format updated to store the number of vertices using different
  number of weights. This information is needed by the custom lighting G3x
  skinning pipelines. Any assets rendered with a G3x skinning pipeline will
  need to be reinstanced to correctly render.

08/01/03 BZ#3438 - Max Exporter - potential crash when
  DFF_HANIMSUBHIERARCHYANIM was used conjuction with
  DFF_FILTERTOPLEVELBIPEDKEYS.

07/01/03 Compressed KeyFrame scheme added for RpHAnim
  RtCmpkey toolkit added to implement a compressed keyframe representing
  matrix animation. This compression scheme works through packing floating
  point values into 16 bit integers and decompressing at runtime. The
  animation data is thus reduced to 60% of the original size.

07/01/03 RtAnim Changes
  Modifications have been made to the RtAnim and RpHAnim plugins allowing for 
  different sized animation vs interpolated keyframes and custom data attached
  to animations.
  This includes the addition of a second keyframe size and so maxKeyframeSize
  variables have been renamed to reflect whether they refer to animation or
  interpolated keyframes.
  Small changes will be necessary in custom keyframe schemes which are
  documented in the RtAnim api ref.

07/01/03 BZ#3777 - RwEngineGetVersion returns RwUInt32 for consistency with
  RwStreamFindChunk

07/01/03 RwTextureRead can now do a user defined search for textures before
  attempting to read them from disk. See RwTextureSetFindCallBack, and
  RwTextureGetFindCallBack. The default callback reproduces the previous
  behaviour which is to search the current texture dictionary if one is
  defined or otherwise search all texture dictionaries in the system.

07/01/03 Win32 skeleton menu FPS limiter
  A common option has been added to all Win32 applications that open the
  skeleton menu system during initialization. This option enables/disables
  the FPS limiter. The default limit is 60 FPS, but this can be changed
  by the application. By default the limiter is DISABLED.
  (OBSOLETE, see 27/01/03 entry)

07/01/03 Cloning atomics with MatFX - BZ#3430
  When cloning cloning an atomic with matfx applied the matfx copy callback
  would also setup the matfx pipes after they had been setup by the atomic
  clone function. This could overwrite things like skin or patch pipes with
  generic matfx pipes when it shouldn't.

06/01/03 The NULL Xbox header now defines NULLXBOX_DRVMODEL_H.
  Previously, the only way of the detecting a NULL Xbox build was checking if
  WIN_OSTYPES_H was defined.

06/01/03 OpenGL Win32 skeleton - BZ#3399
  Alt+Tab task switching was not handled by RenderWare Graphics
  examples.

03/01/03 GCN - BZ#3350
  RwIm2d Immediate mode now applies the sub raster offset.

16/12/02 GCN BZ# 2842
  All pipelines now disable the color channels as well as setting the number
  of channels output to the TEV.

16/12/02 GCN BZ# 3084
  All pipelines now disable unneeded color channels.

16/12/02 GCN BZ# 3083
  Alpha lighting was being enabled with color lighting but never used. All
  alpha lighting is now disabled.

16/12/02 Xbox build machine upgraded to use the December 2002 SDK (#5233).
  IMPORTANT NOTE: This is the last XDK to support Visual Studio 6.

13/12/02 PS2
  If a camera texture raster is created mipmaped and automipmaped, the
  mip stack will be auto generated on RwCameraEndUpdate()

13/12/02 PS2 RpPDS - Added G3x Uva and Dup Uva pipelines.
  Both skinned and static, supporting ADL, A4D and APL lighting.

13/12/02 BZ#3322 - RtLtmap - Lightmap rasters now carry the
  rwRASTERGAMMACORRECTED.
  Note that this flag will be lost in the event of the lightmaps being saved
  in separate files.

12/12/02 PS2
  For SN builds, now use to 2.95.3 as this is default in ProDG 3.0
  Note that their default /usr/local/sce/ee/gcc/ee/include/machine/setjmp.h
  is broken. SN users should recover this from the Sony 2.96 distribution.

12/12/02 RwFrame streaming modifications BZ#2912
  Added support for frame lists to be built from branches of hierarchies.
  This fixes a bug where memory trampling could occur if an RpClumps frame
  had siblings.

11/12/02 GCN PTank
  Code modifications to reduce setup cost and state leakage.

11/12/02 GCN Toon
  Code modifications to reduce setup cost and state leakage.

11/12/02 BZ#2945 - Added RpPTankAtomicSkySwapFrames functions for frame
swapping mangement. Changed RpPTankSkyGetPreviousBuffer to
RpPTankAtomicSkyGetPreviousBuffer.

10/12/02 BZ#3272 - OpenGL Team
  Static shadows were not rendering.

10/12/02 BZ#2424 - Lithmap plugin.
  When loading a lightmap with a format different than the lightmap platform
  default, the plugin won't perform any conversion and just message the user
  with the proposed format.

09/12/02 Examples, Demos
  Adding .net project files for examples and demos for pc & xbox.

06/12/02 BZ#3120 - 2dconvert : 2dconvert could clear the text style record
  when converting some odd text string object.

06/12/02 GCN BZ#3236 Removed hard code renderMode from skeleton so examples
  will work in PAL or NTSC by default.

06/12/02 GCN BZ#3247 Compressed vertex support for normals in RpWorlds was
  broken if using, rpS8 or rpS16 formats.

06/12/02 PrtStd Example
   New example, prtstd2, added to show how custom properties are added to
   RpPrtStd for animating particles.

05/12/02 BZ#2247 - Maetro : when streaming in an rt2d string object, if the
  font is not found, this will be ignored by the maestro wich will keep on
  rendering. Streaming out that kind of object is not supported.

05/12/02 OpenGL vertex arrays and world lighting
  RenderWare Graphics OpenGL vertex array functions have been moved from
  the world into the core library. These have been promoted to API status:

   RwOpenGLVASetPosition, RwOpenGLVASetPositionATI, RwOpenGLVADisablePosition
   RwOpenGLVASetNormal, RwOpenGLVASetNormalATI, RwOpenGLVADisableNormal
   RwOpenGLVASetColor, RwOpenGLVASetColorATI, RwOpenGLVADisableColor
   RwOpenGLVASetTexCoord, RwOpenGLVASetTexCoordATI, RwOpenGLVADisableTexCoord
   RwOpenGLVASetMultiTexCoord, RwOpenGLVASetMultiTexCoordATI

  Also OpenGL world lighting functions have been promoted to API:

   RpOpenGLWorldEnableLighting, RpOpenGLWorldDisableLighting
   RpOpenGLWorldIsLightingEnabled

   RpOpenGLWorldSetMaterialProperties, RpOpenGLWorldDisableColorMaterial

   RpOpenGLWorldEnableNormalize, RpOpenGLWorldDisableNormalize

  The stealth variable _rwOpenGLOpaqueBlack has been removed. This can easily
  be replaced in render callbacks with glColor4f( 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f );

05/12/02 BZ#3112 RpPrtStd : texture refcount was not properly updated when
  destroying a streamed prtstd atomic.

04/12/02 BZ#3189 RpSline
  Changed logic test in RpSplineFindPosition from || to &&

04/12/02 OpenGL texturing
  Added the API function
	RwOpenGLSetTexture
  to bind an RwTexture to OpenGL. This is useful for all-in-one node render
  callbacks.

  Also promoted _rwOpenGLSetActiveTextureUnit and
  _rwOpenGLGetActiveTextureUnit to API status, so they are now
  RwOpenGLSetActiveTextureUnit and RwOpenGLGetActiveTextureUnit.

03/12/02 Maya Exporters
  Check in for fix for multiple sets(shaderingGroups) using same shader bug.

03/12/02 BZ#1558 Visualizer Xbox big patches. The LOD value is clamped at
  runtime to generate less than 65535 vertices per atomic, due to a hardware
  limitation on the maximun number of vertices per DrawIndexedPrimitive call.

03/12/02 BZ#3062 - OpenGL & PI texture dictionaries: rwRASTERFORMATAUTOMIPMAP
  OpenGL texture dictionaries did not save the rwRASTERFORMATAUTOMIPMAP flag.
  This could cause problems upon reading some texture dictionaries. The format
  of OpenGL texture dictionaries has now changed to accomodate this. PC OpenGL
  and Macintosh OpenGL texture dictionaries are now different. Existing
  OpenGL texture dictionaries can still be read.
  PI texture dictionaries also do not store this flag, but now ensure that it
  is not used when creating PS rasters while reading a PI texture dictionary.
  Binary version number incremented to 34004.

03/12/02 BZ#3172 - RtLtmap. Lightmap can now be anysize. Creatubg a Lightmap
  bigger than 512x512 will throw an assert when created as they can slow down
  performances.

03/12/02 BZ#2689 - PS2All. Added assert to RpMeshPS2AllSyncTextureUpload
  and multi pass pipelines if texture upload fails.

03/12/02 BZ#2621 - RpMeshSetTriStripMethod missing see also added.

03/12/02 BZ#3043 - Material stream rights callback added.

03/12/02 BZ#2930 - RwMatrixOptimize now uses identity tolerance.

03/12/02 BZ#2756 - PS2All default material pipeline assert moved to prevent
  bogus asserts.

03/12/02 BZ#3111 - LtMapObjectLightMapRead now check if there is a current
  texture dictionnary before using it.
  Added FULLSCENELIGHTING define, which, when defined, allow a generation
  lightmap for a complete scene rather thanjust what's lie in the camera
  frustrum.

03/12/02 BZ#2846 - PS2 Allow blit from an indexed to a non-indexed texture,
  16- to 32-bit and 32- to 16-bit texture.

03/12/02 BZ#3081 - Potential Floating point/Endianess bug fix in bageomet.c

02/12/02 BZ#2984 Xbox & D3D8 - MatFX bumpmapping and compressed textures:
  only supported if the bumpmap texture is NULL and the base texture has
  the bumpmap encoded into the alpha channel.

02/12/02 BZ#2719 - PS2 PPVU example : a 16 bit constant was used in place of a
  15 bit one, preventing compilation when using SN compiler suite.

02/12/02 BZ#3142 DX8 Clearing the Stencil does not work, fixed.

02/12/02 BZ#2940 : ClmpView and disabling hanim animation
  When HAnim is disabled, but the current clump is Hanimated,
  RpHAnimUpdateHierarchyMatrices is now allways called, allowing clump
  manipulation.

02/12/02 BZ#2700 PS2 skel main loop
  Dropped poll to 5ms as I believe that throttling is still required.

02/12/02 BZ#3093 XBox RwXboxDDSTextureRead can crash without assert, fixed.

28/11/02 PS2 Visualizer
  Update for 2.6.0 Libs.

27/11/02 PS2 Build
  PS2 build machine now builds against sce libs 2.6.0.

26/11/02 BZ#2981 Xbox - Exposed the function RwXboxLightsEnable that
  must be used inside the lighting callbacks.

22/11/02 RpPrtStd & RpPrtAdv
  Renamed structures and functions in RpPrtAdv to reduce its length
  fixed some strange naming.
  Fixed particle texture coords step property. Pointers are not
  allowed in particles since this would break single batch on the PS2.
  Introducing version stamping in emitter streaming to fix file compatibility
  problems after the introduction of 2D rotation.

20/11/02 BZ#2841 - rpLTMAPDEFAULTSLIVERAREATHRESHOLD and

  pipelines without a known lighting setup added.

13/11/02 Docschangelog added to build.

13/11/02 BZ#2817 - OpenGL extension enumeration
  The RenderWare Graphics extension enumeration may have crashed under
  particular circumstances on some video cards.

13/11/02 Xbox - RwXboxDeviceConfig structure changed to provide full control
  over the device creation parameters.
  Provided the function RwXboxDeviceConfigGetDefaultValues for initializing
  the device config structure with the default values used by RenderWare
  Graphics.

12/11/02 BZ#2747 - RtLtMapDefaultVisCallBack use a user modifiable value when
  validating it's collision test.
  Added RtLtMapSetVisCallBackCollisionScalar
  Added RtLtMapGetVisCallBackCollisionScalar

  RwVideoMode extended to support refresh rate and raster format.
  RwVideoModeFlag extended to support platform specific video modes, added:
    PS2  : rwVIDEOMODE_PS2_FSAASHRINKBLIT
           rwVIDEOMODE_PS2_FSAAREADCIRCUIT
    XBox : rwVIDEOMODE_XBOX_WIDESCREEN
           rwVIDEOMODE_XBOX_PROGRESSIVE
           rwVIDEOMODE_XBOX_FIELD
           rwVIDEOMODE_XBOX_10X11PIXELASPECT

12/11/02 BZ#2723 - PS2 Examples
  Fix ps2 example mcps to have correct debug settings.

06/11/02 BZ#2607
  RwEngineInit, memFuncs have been made const.
  RwEngineOpen can not be made const because of internal code design.

06/11/02 BZ#2596
  RwMatrixRotateOneMinusCosineSine was unnecessarily over setting the
  matrix flags too many times.

06/11/02 GCN BZ#2401
  Default mesh rendering in the Team matFX pipeline was not being set up
  correctly.

06/11/02 GCN BZ#2333
  The GXFifoObj pointer stored inside RenderWare Graphics was being set to
  NULL when RwEngineClose was being called. This has now been fixed.

06/11/02 BZ#2570. RpPrtStd and RpPrtAdv.
  Added RpPrtStdEmitterPrt2DRotate and RpPrtStdParticle2DRotate for 2D
  rotation support in particles.
  Removed RpPrtStdEmitterPrtAnimFrame and RpPrtStdParticleAnimFrame from
  RpPrtStd. This is done in RpPrtAdv.

06/11/02 Xbox build machine upgraded to use the November 2002 SDK (#5120).

05/11/02 (build) seperated api-refs from pdf docs, changed top level
  and platform specific makefiles for handling autogenerated pdfs

05/11/02 BZ#2667 : RtPITexD not handling texture addressing properly.
  If U and V texture addressing were different, RtPITexD recorded these
  incorrectly. The fix records each texture addressing mode separately.
  Now, if invalid addressing modes are detected when reading a PI texture
  dictionary RtPITexD handles these by the following:
  1) if both addressing modes are invalid, both are set to 
     rwTEXTUREADDRESSWRAP.
  2) if one is invalid, it is set equal to the other, valid, addressing mode.

05/11/02 BZ#2606 : missing RpHAnimHierarchyGetCurrentAnim
  Added RtAnimInterpolatorGetCurrentAnim
  Added RpHAnimHierarchyGetCurrentAnim

04/11/02 GCN BZ#2207
  RwGameCubeCameraTextureFlush was incorrectly calculating the src rectangle
  for the box filter copy.

01/11/02 PS2 - Added Atomic xyzw cluster instancing for ADC pipelines.

01/11/02 BZ#2608 RpSpline
  Changed logic test in RpSplineFindMatrix from || to &&

31/10/02 PS2 - Added generic and World Sector xyzw cluster for ADC pipelines.

30/10/02 (build) Added automated PDF generation files and config to
  build process, includes an .wsf script and xml doc list.

25/10/02 Maya Exporter - Added place holder for MotionPath Animation. Added
  warnings when using MotionPath and not using Dynamic Keyframe Generation.

25/10/02 Maya Exporter - Fixed an Attribute Editor bug when the AE is embedded
  in the Maya main window.

25/10/02 Exporters - Added guard against animated visibility crashing the
  exporter. A warning is now displayed for affected nodes.

24/10/02 Exporters - Added check against duplicate Tag ID's in a heirarchy.

23/10/02 Maya Exporter - Fixed an infinite loop caused by cross-referenced
  constraint nodes.

21/10/02 Rt2d - Added font read callback functions to allow overriding of
  font sources - see Rt2dFontSetReadCallBack, Rt2dFontCallBackRead and
  Rt2dFontGetReadCallBack.

21/10/02 AppWizard hierarchy bug fix (bug #2344)
  Fixed bug in CRenderWare::_AttachHierarchy() that would return NULL if
  an atomic did not contain a skin, which would incorrectly terminate the
  calling iterator.

21/10/02 MatFX - NEW UV Animation effects.
  Two new effects have been added:
	rpMATFXEFFECTUVANIM
	rpMATFXEFFECTDUALUVANIM
  These are equivalent to a standard single or dual pass but with
  texture coordinate transformations applied. The transforms can be set for
  either effect using RpMatFXMaterialSetUVAnimTransforms and they allow
  scaling, translation, rotation, and shearing of textures. The matfx1
  example has been updated to demonstrate the new effects. Using these
  effects is much more efficient than modifying the texture coordinates
  directly and then re-instancing.

17/10/02 Toon, major internal code modification and restructuring.

17/10/02 Maya Exporter - Integrated maya 4.5 into the build process

16/02/02 bz#2246 Xbox - Fixed a bug on RwXbVertexBufferLockDiscard due to D3D
  internal references checks.

16/10/02 OpenGL display list/vertex array support updates.
  * Now supports the GL_ATI_vertex_array_object extension (VAO) for
    server-side vertex arrays. This is a companion to NVIDIA's
    GL_NV_vertex_array_range extension (VAR).
  * Display lists are now only instanced when neither VAO nor VAR are
    available since these extensions provide better performance in vertex
    arrays. 
  * VAO is not used in skinning nor particles for performance issues. This
    will change when direct mapping to video memory becomes available for VAOs.
  * _rwOpenGLVertexHeapSetSize(), used to set the VAR heap, can now be called
    before RwEngineInit() if required.

15/10/02 3ds max Exporter - Fixed a bug in RwMaterial when the platform 
  extension was turned on but the effect file was not specified.

14/10/02 bz#2295 DMorph example - Fixed a bug with second and third lights in
  main.c

14/10/02 Maya Exporter - Fixed a bug when joint and orientConstraint nodes
  were feeding off each other.

11/10/02 OpenGL miscellaneous updates:
  * Stealth material functions consolidated: _rwOpenGLEnableColorMaterial
    changed to _rwOpenGLSetColorMaterial and merged functionality with
    glColorMaterial. Also added _rwOpenGLLightsSetMaterialProperties to
    simplify render callbacks when lighting is enabled.
  * Render callback code for no-lighting simplified.
  * Normal normalization state caching added to world lighting module.
  * Fast paths to renderstate set/gets for all internal plugins added.

11/10/02 GCN Made RpGameCubeWorldGetVtxFmt & RpGameCubeGeometryGetVtxFmt
  Macros in release builds.

11/10/02 GCN Defined RWALIGN to align.

11/10/02 GCN Added extern "C" around _RwGameCubeTextureExtOffset.

11/10/02 RwV3dTransformPoints & RwV3dTransformVectors are now over loadable in
  the driver without the over head of an additional function call.

11/10/02 GCN Texture extensions in gcn & nullgcn builds are now the same size.

11/10/02 (Bug #2227) OpenGL MatFX dual pass bug.
  If the rpGEOMETRYTEXTURED2 flag is not set, and a dual texture exists, the
  first set of texture coordinates should be reused for the dual texture.
  OpenGL previously always assumed that a second texture coordinate set
  existed and used that.

10/10/02 OpenGL MatFX environment map optimization.
  Added a special case to environment mapping when the shinyness parameter is
  set to 1.0f (or 255). If the GL_ARB_multitexture and 
  GL_ARB_texture_env_combine extensions are available, multitexturing can be
  used here. Otherwise dual pass is used. Multitexturing cannot be used 
  generally since there is no multiply-add texture combiner.

10/10/02 OpenGL custom instancing function removed for all-in-one nodes.
  This feature was not used and is not necessary. API functions
  RxOpenGLAllInOneSetInstanceFn and RxOpenGLAllInOneGetInstanceFn removed.

10/10/02 (Bug #2190) Fatal nullxbox driver bug, fixed to allocate memory for
  textures as a multiple of 4 bytes.

10/10/02 OpenGL multitexturing and vertex arrays
  Moved the glClientActiveTextureARB call from the multitexture
  vertex array setup to _rwOpenGLSetActiveTextureUnit. Ensures applications
  using custom vertex array setup functions will still work correctly.

08/10/02 (PR#3901) Blinking lights fixed by updating the destination matrix
  flags:
  * If the source matrix is identity, destination flags are set to identity.
  * If the source matrix is orthonormal, destination flags are set to
    orthonormal.
  * In any other case the destinations flags are set to zero.

08/10/02 Maya Exporter - Exporting multiple dff or bsp nodes at once to
  different directories was broken. All assets were being placed in the same
  directory. This is now fixed.

08/10/02 Xbox build machine upgraded to use the October 2002 SDK (#5028).

04/10/02 3ds max Exporter - Spline export used to fail if there were other
  batch nodes before it. Fixed now.

03/10/02 Maya Exporter - Fixed the naming problem with files on the network.

03/10/02 API Reference - can now click on folder name to open folder
  Previously you need to select a function name or page to display the
  html page.

03/10/02 (PR#3894) Fixed matrix particles on sky2.
  Frame swapping and querying previous frame buffer did not check for fastpipe
  and thus returning null pointers.
  Also fixeding missing clone callbacks for sky2.

03/10/02 3ds max Exporter - Fixed Auto Create Nodes not to set hanim option
  if there is only morphing or dmorphing

02/10/02 (PR#3893) D3D8 RwEngineGetVideoModeInfo bug, fixed.

01/10/02 API Reference built with 1.2.18-20020927 Doxygen version which fixes
  cross references.

01/10/02 PS2 palette placement
  Fix for palette being placed incorrectly for 256x32 mipmaped textures
  PR#3891

01/10/02 (PR#3888) Xbox Texture dictionary loading crash. Added support for
  the old binary format.

01/10/02 (PR#3887) Xbox VSHADER example, fixed.

30/09/02 3ds max Exporter - We didn't support target animation for target
  lights and cameras. Fixed now.

30/09/02 RenderWare Graphics Build Tool
  If resources are modified at shutdown, there is now a "cancel" option to
  return to the application.

27/09/02 (PR#3854) RpPrtStd & RpPrtAdv. PrtStd atomics could not be cloned
  because of empty copy functions. Added clone callbacks for all emitter
  properties, Particles and PTank are not copied. Only the emitters.
  Added new API, RpPrtStdEmitterClone.

26/09/02 (PR#3878) Doxygen version reverted back to 1.2.17.

26/09/02 (PR#3884) Xbox RpTeam static shadows, fixed.

25/09/02 Maya Exporter - Fixed texture transformation matrix

25/09/02 Rt2d - Added Unicode support. UNICODE build is no longer necessary.
  Updated docs on how Unicode is supported and enabled.

24/09/02 Exporters - Fixed Ligtmap bug with objects without textures.

20/09/02 3ds max Exporter - We were not enabling the matfx on the world
  sectors when rwmaterials had only xbox or gamecube extencions. Fixed now.

20/09/02 3ds max Exporter - RwCommImage::ConvertToTrueColor() bug
  There was a bug in this function resulting more in corrupted data.
  This function was used only when opacity map was burned into the
  diffuse map which was palletized, so we converted it into the true
  color map. It is fixed now.

20/09/02 (rw-bug #3842) - Rt2d/Maestro - Fixed problem with color offsets
and tints

20/09/02 3ds max Exporter - Self-Illumination was ignored
  It is fixed now.

19/09/02 (Bug No: 1940) Maya and 3ds max particle exporting - The parent
  scaling for the particle emitters is now burned into the emitter size on
  export. 3ds max and Maya are both more WYSIWYG than before; however scenes
  before this fix, that used parent scaling, might need adjusting.

18/09/02 3ds max Exporter - "Export User Property Values (RpUserData)"
  was reset to false for the old scenes in the new exporter. This is fixed
  now, so if you load the old scene option will be set correctly. If you
  resaved the in the meantime since the 3.4 release on 30/08/02 and used
  the option, it will be reset to false, so you'll have to manually set it
  on again. By default this option is off.

17/09/02 3ds max Exporter - "Export User Property Values (RpUserData)"
  option was ignored by the exporter and we always used to export strings
  from the object properties as the user data. Fixed now.

17/09/02 (PR#3851) Xbox team plugin doesn't support re-start, fixed.

17/09/02 OpenGL ambient lighting was modulated with itself.
  Global ambient is still accumulated and modulated with material ambient
  but now GL_LIGHT_MODEL_AMBIENT is set to opaque white.

16/09/02 PS2 Display/DrawBufferRaster
  As part of the preparations for fully custom video modes, the internal
  implementation of RpSkyGetDisplayBufferRaster() & RpSkyGetDrawBufferRaster()
  have changed. RpSkyGetDisplayBufferRaster now works correctly in FSAA0
  modes.

16/09/02 Xbox now built against September 2002 XDK QFE patched to 4928.2.

13/09/02 Exporters - There is a change of behaviour in 3ds max 5 for Assign
  Vertex Colors utility. With default options it will assign prelight color
  per face per vertex and the same vertex when approached from the different
  faces will have different prelight color. This will result in exporter
  duplicating vertices. The real solution is to turn on the "Mix vertex
  colors" option in the utility. We now do the rounding in the exporter
  of the color values to an 0-255 int before remapper which helps, but still
  is not perfect, so we'll display a warning if too many vertices are
  duplicated. Any way the option should be used. We'll also output info on
  the number of vertices duplicated due to normals and uvs differences.

13/09/02 Prtstd example max particle count and softras ptank creation (PR#3838)
  The default maximum particle count in the Prtstd example has been reduced
  from 30,000 to 10,000 since this can cause problems with RpGeometryCreate
  exceeding the maximum number of vertices.
  Softras RpPTank exhibited this problem and will now report an error if the
  maximum particle count is exceeded.

13/09/02 PS2 dma manager
  Added frame rate control (ability to lock to 30, etc) and yield callback to
  allow "wasted" cpu time to be returned to the application, and dma buffer
  usage to be monitored. Added extra FLUSH in Gate to allow for possible
  sync failure.

11/09/02 GCN Upgraded to Dolphin1.0 SDK Sept 2002.

11/09/02 (PR #3827 & PR #3830)
  Fixed Rt2dDeviceSetMetric not working correctly.
  Fixed Rt2dDeviceGetMetric. Was accidently removed from a previous check in.

11/09/02 (PR#3829) Win skeleton windowed mode, updating RsGlobal.maximumWidth
  and RsGlobal.maximumHeight after creating the window.

10/09/02 (PR#3825) GCN Added weight ordering code to skin plugin to prevent
  compressed weights terminating skinning too early.

10/09/02 PS2 texture cache
  The function RpSkyTextureCacheSetState() has been removed.

09/09/02 Xbox build machine upgraded to use the September 2002 SDK (#4928).

09/09/02 (PR#3815) Softras HH API header now included as part of a binary SDK.

03/09/02 (PR#3798) PDS now works with rwENGINEINITNOFREELISTS.

02/09/02 PTank - SKY : Instancing code for fast pipe could
  miss a buffer instance when using multi-buffering displaying flicking in
  visualizer (CL 54798).

02/09/02 ======================================================[80 Characters]==
  Branched to RW34Active.

30/08/02 (PR#3441) RtLineSphereIntersectionTest now takes an extra argument
  to return the distance parameter, rather than this being the return
  value. The return value is now an RwBool, and indicates whether an
  intersection was found. This removes the previous ambiguity of
  a return value of -1.

29/08/02 PrtStd - sky : added support for multi buffering particles
         PrtStd - sky : maximum batch is now automatically updated when too
         big.

29/08/02 3ds max 5 viewport rendering
  3ds max 5 multi texture viewport rendering has been disabled due to
  problems with D3D support changes in 3ds max 5. Single texture viewing
  is still available.

28/08/02 Xbox now built against August 2002 XDK QFE patched to 4831.5

28/08/02 OpenGL MatFX bumpmapping bug fix (PR#3770) - texture coordinates
  in a vertex array were given a bad stride.

27/08/02 Binary version number incremented to 34003.
  Streamed worlds now store the world bounding box rather than it
  being regenerated on load.

27/08/02 Removed RpLight types from baequ.*
  baequ was defining global ints containing RpLight types for use in
  assembler. These are currently unused and have been removed to fix a
  dependency on rpworld when building rwcore or plcore.

23/08/02 GCN Doubled FIFO to prevent submitting thread from being put to
  sleep.

22/08/02 (PR#3687) (PR#3754) (change list 54215)
  matrix array pointers where not set to null when not used, in function
  RpHAnimHierarchyCreate
  release/compatibility macro to call function((param)) rather than
  function(param)

22/08/02 (PR#3613) RtQuatTransformVectors now functions correctly
  when input and output arrays are coincident.

22/08/02 (PR#3753) Removed unneeded flag setting from RwMatrixTransform.

21/08/02 RpPrtAdv, FxPack : user guide checked in

21/08/02 RtAnim: new API function:
  RtAnimAnimationGetNumNodes returns the number of animation nodes
  compatible with an RtAnimAnimation.

21/08/02 (PR#3736) DMorph:
  - A tolerance is now used when deciding which vertices are deltas
  since during modelling, small errors can often be introduced between base
  and target vertices that are intended to be identical. In such cases,
  this fix will reduce data size, and increase animation update efficiency.

20/08/02 Skeleton - RsSelectDevice
  Made a minor modification to the order of events in the skeleton startup.
  As a result RsSelectDevice is now called in a state where the applications
  plugins have not been attached. This is part of the fix for PR#3739

20/08/02 Maestro/Rt2d/Rt2dAnim :  Multiple changes
    Rt2dAnimOpen must be called before using rt2danim functionality, including
    playing Maestro animations.
    Rt2dAnimClose must be called on shutdown.
    API functions Rt2dShapeGetNewPath and Rt2dShapeGetNewBrush have been
    removed. Rt2dPathCreate() and Rt2dBrushCreate() should be used instead.
    Maestro animations and static 2d streamed objects must be reexported.

16/08/02 (PR#3732) GCN Fixed crash bug when calling RwEngineStop.

16/08/02 RpSkin : Change list 53582.
  Updated docs and Userguide to include skin split.
  Added new API RpSkinIsSplit.

15/08/02 RpPTank - rpPDS - SKY2 - Cloning Pipelines : Changelist 53529
  cStack was not correcly accessed in RpPDS_G3x_ADLCloneRender
  changed FAVORITEORGANISATIONMODE to FLAGARRAY
  Added platform specific (SKY2) flags : rpPTANKSKYFLAGUSECLONEPIPELINE
  Added cloning utility functions :
  RpPTankAtomicSkyCloneSetReferenceAtomic
  RpPTankAtomicSkyCloneGetReferenceAtomic
  RpPTankAtomicSkyCloneSetAmbientLight
  RpPTankAtomicSkyCloneGetAmbientLight
  RpPTankAtomicSkyCloneSetDirectionalLight
  RpPTankAtomicSkyCloneGetDirectionalLight

15/08/02 RpPrtStd : Changelist 53513.
  Added ref counting to RpPrtStd.
  Added API, RpAtomicIsParticleEmitter.

15/08/02 (PR#3380) GCN Display list generation now asserts if the number of
  indices is greater or equal to 0xFFFF.

15/08/02 (PR#3712) GCN RwGameCubeGetXFBs optimisation bug fixed.

14/08/02 RtAnimInterpolatorAddAnimTime (and SubAnimTime) optimizations
  Previously the interpolator cached the current pairs of key frames to be
  interpolated, but it now just caches pointers to the keyframes within the
  animation. This was found to be more efficient on all platforms, especially
  for high density keyframe data. The rtANIMGETINERPFRAME1 and
  rtANIMGETINTERPFRAME2 macros are now no longer available as the cached
  arrays no longer exist. Instead, a distinction is now made between
  the keyframes in the animation which have an RtAnimKeyFrameHeader and
  the interpolated frames in the interpolator which have an
  RtAnimInterpFrameHeader. This header contains pointers to the current
  keyframe pair.

14/08/02 PS2 build machine
  Now builds against sce 2.5.5

13/08/02 (PR#3696) Xbox Bump Mapping effect changed to get similar results to
  the other platforms. Changelist #53285.

13/08/02 RpSkin (PR#3439)
  Changed an assert to allow the setting of NULL hierarchies on a skin.

13/08/02 Build: RtPNG on NULLxxx targets, Changelist #53268.
  NULLSKY, NULLGCN and NULLXBOX builds now produce an extra CodeWarrior
  specific PNG toolkit library.

13/08/02 Rt2d : Change list 53215.
  Fixed METRIC2 bitmap fonts always using 32bit textures, even if the source
  image wasn't.

13/08/02 (PR#3660) GCN Added an assert in to the native texture dictionary
  reading code to assert on non GCN texture dictionaries.

12/08/02 RtBoneSplit & RtSkinSplit : Changelist 52570.
  Renamed RtBoneSplit to RtSkinSplit. Some functions in RpSkin were also
  renamed from bone split to skin split.

12/08/02 MatFX : Changelist #53136
  (PR#3707) Fix to change on 23/07/02 (PR#3565) that caused matfx bumpmapped
    objects to fail to load in the clumpviewer due to the way it handles
    RwErrors.
  (PR#3698) If multiple materials share the same bumped version of a texture
    this was generated for every material and added multiple times to the
    texture dictionary. They are now generated once and picked up from the
    texture dictionary for subsequent materials.

12/08/02 RpPrtStd : Changelist 52977
  Renamed RpPrtStdGetDontStreamAll to RpPrtStdGlobalDataGetStreamEmbedded.
  Also renamed the set function.

08/08/02 rwMATRIXTYPEORTHOGONAL spelling correction
  Corrected the spelling of rwMATRIXTYPEORTHOGONAL from rwMATRIXTYPEORTHOGANAL

08/08/02 (PR#2856) GCN RwGameCubeCameraTextureFlush now takes a second
  parameter to enable the box filter on the EFB copy.

08/08/02 RpPrtStd and RpPrtAdv plugin attach naming standards:
  Changelist #52804.
  Changed RpParticleAdvancePluginAttach to RpPrtAdvPluginAttach.
  Changed RpParticleStandardPluginAttach to RpPrtStdPluginAttach.

08/08/02 (PR#3553) GCN Fixed infinite loop bug in dlFputs.

08/08/02 (PR#3662) GCN If the maximum number of used global lights exceeds the
  8 HW limit then all remaining global lights are ignored.

08/02/02 RpDMorphAtomicInitalize corrected to RpDMorphAtomicInitialize.
  Changelist #52853

08/08/02 Obselete RpStereo plugin removed

08/08/02 (build) Defaults for examples COPTIMIZE : Changelist #52839
  Modified where the defaults for COPTIMIZE are setup to ensure that all
  platforms will build optimized examples by default in release builds.

08/08/02 RpPrtStd. Change list #52783.
  Removed redundant callbacks. The particle stream callbacks are no longer
  used. Re-enabled particle batch create callback.

07/08/02 PR#3689 D3D8 team plugin vertexbuffers not released with TnL cards.
  Fixed, changelist #52774.

06/08/02 GCN - Single Weight skinning on HW.

  RpSkin & RpTeam have been updated to use HW support for single weight
  skinning. The number of active bones used by a skin must be less than or
  equal to 10 unless, RtBoneSplitAtomicSplitGeometry has been used.

  IMPORTANT:
  The pre-instance binary format has been broken for skinned geometry's.
  All pre-instanced skinned geometry's will have to be regenerated.

06/08/02 Changelist #52640 sectoredit/pvsedit
  Removed sectoredit from build process and added pvsedit

05/08/02 RpSkin, RpBoneSplit. New toolkit added to split meshes such that each
  mesh only use a fixed number of bone matrices. During rendering only those 
  bones are loaded into the HW platform, not the entire hierarchy. Binary 
  file version number bumped due to a change in the RpSkin file format.

05/08/02 Xbox build machine upgraded to use the August 2002 SDK 
  (build number 4831).

05/08/02 (PR#3660) Reading non-native texture dictionaries. Added an assert
  to the D3D8 and Xbox versions that fails if the texture dictionary is from
  another platform: Changelist 52494.

02/08/02 OpenGL All-In-One pipelines introduced : Changelist(s) #52407/8.

01/08/02 RpAnisot : Changelist #52309
  Fixed problem with size function returning non-zero for no data written

01/08/02 PDS, PS2Manager and generic PowerPipe
  Integrated support for the new PDS (Pipeline Delivery System) on PS2. This
  system allows the selection of custom rendering pipelines on the PS2, see
  the PDS documentation for further details on the pipelines supplied. Because
  the system now contains all the default rendering pipelines as well as the
  new custom pipelines it is necessary for all PS2 applications to use PDS and
  register the pipes they require at startup, see the PS2 skeleton code for
  simple details.
  As part of this integration the PS2Manager pipeline system has been removed
  to a new toolkit called RtAltpipe. PS2Manager has been superceded by PS2All,
  however any applications written to use PS2Manager may continue to do so by
  attaching the new toolkit.
  The generic c code implementation of the default PowerPipe nodes and
  pipelines has also been removed to a separate toolkit, rtgncpip, by 
  attaching this toolkit an application can continue use of the original
  generic c pipes if required. Note the softras driver still requires the use
  of the generic c nodes and hence has a link dependancy on this new toolkit.

31/07/02 RtWorldImport : Changelist #52266
  Fixed world bounding box rare bug. Fixed tight bboxes for empty sectors,
  volume is now nil.

31/07/02 Removed RpHAnimHierarchyHAnimKeyFrameAddAnimTime : Changelists #52199
                                                                        #52224
  The function RpHAnimHierarchyHAnimKeyFrameAddAnimTime has been removed.
  Use RpHAnimHierarchyAddAnimTime instead. A legacy macro has been provided.

30/07/02 LtMap toolkit (PR#3659) RtLtMapLightMapsCreate now check if a world
  got 2 tex coords set only if it encounter a world sector with flag
  rtLTMAPOBJECTLIGHTMAP set. enabling the use of emtpy world to generate
  lightmaps on non world object only (change list #52104).

26/07/02 MatFX (gcn): New single pass bumpmap and bump-env pipelines
  - The standard bump map method is now almost exactly the same as PS2 and is
    implemented completely on hardware. This is likely to be the cheapest and
    simplest option for bump mapping on GameCube. Previously bump uv offsets
    were calculated in a generic way on the CPU.
  - The method now supports compressed vertex formats, pre-instancing,
    morphing, skinning, and the UseFrameBufferAlpha option (even when the
    frame buffer does not contain an alpha channel since this is mocked up
    on the TEV).
  - Standard env mapping now also supports UseFrameBufferAlpha option, but
    the frame buffer must actually contain alpha in this case.
  - This is NOT related to the MatFX GameCube multitexturing extension which
    offers more advanced effects.

26/07/02 RwFreeList/rwENGINEINITNOFREELISTS : Changelist #51914
  RwFreeList implementation was ignoring the rwENGINEINITNOFREELISTS
  flag for RwEngineInit() and reserving space for internal freelist objects
  anyway. Now fixed.

26/07/02 NULL target RenderWare Graphics DLL name change : Changelist #51910
  DLL-related files generated by the RWDLL=1 make option now use a different
  naming convention:
	* rwg.dll
	* rwg.lib	(import library)

25/07/02 RtWorldImport : Changelist #50725
  The Hints data structure and its get and set functions have changed to
  make room for a new hint type, there are now 'partition' hints and 'shield'
  hints. If access is made to the structures elements directly, these need
  updating.
  The new functions are RtWorldImportHintsSetGroup and
  RtWorldImportHintsGetGroup, but the old functions are still supported for
  backwards compatibility.
  Also, a new schemes has been add that work soley with hints.

24/07/02 PLCore only builds : Changelist #51720
  Added support for PLCore only builds which includes a smaller size for
  the globals, resulting in a smaller memory overhead when only using PLCore.

23/07/02 PR#3565 MatFX streaming has now been made endian safe
  This was causing problems when pre-instancing on GameCube.

23/07/02 Default PlayStation2 video mode for examples
  The default video mode for the examples on PlayStation2 has been changed
  to a high res anti-aliased mode.

22/07/02 rwRENDERSTATEALPHAPRIMITIVEBUFFER and rwRENDERSTATEFOGTABE removed.
  These render states have been completely removed from the API since
  their functionality is no longer supported on any platform.

17/07/02 RtIntel removed
  Support for the RtIntel toolkit has been removed from RenderWare. Where
  a platform can support the SIMD operations offered by RtIntel the driver
  can implement these optimisations if required.

17/07/02 OpenGL & Softras (PR#3634) PTank vertex alpha flag when FALSE
  but particle color alpha != 255 and using a texture with alpha now
  renders correctly.

16/07/02 RwFreeList implementation changed...
  ...to decrease the number of allocations needed and to allow the user
  control over RenderWare's freelist sizes to tune them for his/her game.
  This should allow for better performance and decreased memory fragmentation.
  The new API function RwFreeListCreateAndPreallocateSpace should now be
  preferred over RwFreeListCreate. See also the RwFreeList overview in the
  API reference for a list of functions used to control freelist sizes.

15/07/02 Xbox and PC (PR#3632) RwFastRealToUInt32 inline assembler functions
  changed to overwrite the default macro with the same name.

12/07/02 PS2 PTank - new pipelines which use much less CPU time are used for
  all PTanks which don't have the rpPTANKDFLAGMATRIX, rpPTANKDFLAGNORMAL or
  rpPTANKDFLAGSTRUCTURE flags set. The rpPTANKSKYFLAGDONTALLOCATE platform
  flag has been added to allow the user to supply the PTank with the required
  memory which would otherwise be allocated when the PTank is created.

11/07/02 GCN (PR#3472) Shadows were disappearing due to uninitialized matrix
  flags.

10/07/02 GCN (PR#3497) _RwGameCubeRasterExtOffset now inside extern "C"
  section.

10/07/02 GCN (PR#3524) RwGameCubeCameraTextureFlush now asserts if the raster
  passed was created with rwRASTERDONTALLOCATE.

05/07/02 (PR#3606) sky/gcn skeleton: error in fgets implementation
  String was not terminated with NULL when maximum characters read.

04/07/02 RpHanim now relies on rtanim to provide it's keyframing and
  interpolating schemes. Where, in previous versions, a RpHAnimHierarchy held
  the animation's current state and the hierarchical data, it now contains
  only a reference to an RtAnimInterpolator object and the hierarchical data
  (matrix arrays, hierarchy definitions, ...).
  A collection of legacy macros and typedefs are provided to ease the move to
  the new system, though direct access to member variables will need to be
  updated.
  The file formats are compatible, and there is no need to re-export data to
  fit the new system.
  See RpHanim and RtAnim API reference for more informations.

02/07/02 Added RtAnim toolkit (first part of Hanim Cut off).

02/07/02 Xbox build machine upgraded to use the July 2002 SDK
  (build number 4721).

01/07/02 (PR#3592) D3D8 - Im3D index buffer size increased to 65535 indices.

28/06/02 3dsmax Exporter - Removed the limit of 100.0 to the area light radius
  in the RwMaterial.

27/06/02 (PR#3581) Pakfile example doesn't work on Xbox, fixed.

26/06/02 (PR#3582) Xbox - Bug in SSE RwMatrixMultiplyMacro. Fixed using
  "shufps" to overwrite the 4th-float value that could have been invalid.

25/06/02 3dsmax Exporter - Fix for procedural textures which caused an
  exception.

24/06/02 Protected the ptank contents when emitting wihtout updating
  - changed order destruction of ptank and its frame
  - _rpPrtStdPropTabAdd was keeping only the first and the last proptab
  - Added memory cleanup in engineclose callback

21/06/02 New tristripper added. The callbacks for this tristripper also allow
  for easier implementation of alternative tristrippers.

20/06/06 PrtStd : changed the streaming function so that it is possible to
  stream out the global data at once, or with each emitter. Modified the
  propTab functions to that intents. Added RpPrtStdGet/SetDontStreamAll flag.

20/06/02 3dsmax Exporter - Fixed a bug with palettised textures with opasity
  map.

18/06/02 Xbox build machine upgraded to use the June 2002 SDK 
  (build number 4627).

18/06/02 3ds max Exporter - Fix for UV values when the UV sets were not
  used in the right order.

17/06/02 PS2: Miplevels and FSAA0 defaults
  The default value of rpSKYRENDERSTATEMAXMIPLEVELS is now 7.
  The default value of _rwSkyFSAAMode0SetVisibleWidth is now the back buffer
  width.

14/06/02 PrtStd : the particle now can completely fill a batch before creating
  a new empty batch.

14/06/02 PS2 library build env. PS2 builds against 2.5.2. Updated ps2.doc/pdf
  (top level readmes).

13/06/02 3ds max Exporter - Fix for rendered textures with alpha
  Alpha was ignored in rws file texture dictionary when the size of the
  texture was not power of 2.

13/06/02 (PR#3520) PTank : texture upload/material setting was badly handled
  forcing the pipeline to upload the texture twice.

12/06/02 NULL target RenderWare Graphics DLL generation
  If the make option RWDLL=1 is used to build the SDK for NULL targets then
  a combined DLL, called rwdll.dll, exporting the majority of the SDK
  functions is generated into a rwsdk/dll/null/[debug|release|metrics] folder.
  An import library called rwdll.lib is also created in this folder for NULL
  applications to link against to "import" the functions contained in the DLL.
  Currently, only the rtpng, rttiff, rpdpvs libraries are not compatible with
  the DLL generation.

12/06/02 RpPrtStd - eClass, pClass and the proptable are now streamed as
  platform independant data that gets realigned upon loading. Removed 4 sky
  - functions made useless by the change. o Added RpPrtStdEmitterLinkPtank
  - function and updated RpPrtStdEmitterCreatePtank accordingly. o
  - Bumped version stamp to 2.

12/06/02 (PR#3511) Maya Exporter. A problem that prevented skinned toon
  clumps from exporting correctly has been fixed.

11/06/02 (PR#3534) RtLtMap - the lightmap UV calculations have been modified
  First of all, the lightmap UV generation has been optimised
  (it was an O(n^2) operation and now is O(n), so extreme cases should
  complete much faster).
  Secondly, two 'magic numbers' have been exposed, so that worlds
  of significantly varying scales may be robustly processed by the
  lightmap generation and illumination code.
  The functions for setting these values, for which there is API
  reference documentation describing their purpose in detail, are:
    RtLtMapSetSliverAreaThreshold
    RtLtMapSetVertexWeldThreshold

11/06/02 (PR#3543) Matfx -cross platform incompatibility.
  Now, the DirectX and Xbox versions use two passes when the base texture
  has alpha, and the framebuffer alpha is disabled.
  Use "RpMatFXMaterialSetEnvMapFrameBufferAlpha" to enable multitexturing
  when the base texture has alpha.

10/06/02 Xbox (PR#3542) ptank point sprites not setting world matrix, fixed.

10/06/02 Xbox (PR#3541) RpAtomicRender resets frame in PTank, fixed.

07/06/02 3ds max - Filter Through Top-Level Biped Keys option bug fix.
  It didn't filter the keyframes on the Bip01 root node.

07/06/02 (PR#3519) The serialization code was incorrectly endianness
  converting causing loading failures on big endian machines.

06/06/02 Xbox (PR#3525) RpD3DTEXTUREOP enum is wrong. Fixed to match the D3D
  definition.

30/05/02 RpPtank : #pr3505 : Added an early out from ptank render when the
number of active particle is 0.

30/05/02 RpPtank : #pr3505 : SetMaterial was destroying the much needed mesh
  when using custom pipes. (might have affected other platforms, not only ps2)

30/05/02 RtWorldImport
  Removed RtWorldImportSetSurfaceProperties and
  RtWorldImportGetSurfaceProperties which were equivalent to the
  removed RpWorldSetSurfaceProperties and RpWorldGetSurfaceProperties.

29/05/02 Xbox - Texture dictionary format changed to read all the mip
  levels at once. Previous tex dictionaries are now incompatible.

29/05/02 Xbox - Added a Write Combining memory manager that provides the
  following benefits:
  - Reduced wasted space due to D3D allocations of 4KB blocks.
  - Reduced memory fragmentation.
  - Improved RwXboxLockDynamicVertexBuffer to never stall the CPU.
  - Immediate mode indexed primitives rendering optimised using
    RwXboxLockDynamicVertexBuffer.
  - Im3D non indexed primitives rendering optimised using BeginPush.

28/05/02  Removed '#include <windows.h>' from D3D8 and NULL public headers.

27/05/02  The following legacy API has been removed.

  RpWorldGetSurfaceProperties
  _rpWorldGetSurfaceProperties

  RpWorldSetSurfaceProperties
  _rpWorldSetSurfaceProperties

27/05/02  The following PS2 API functions have changed to accommodate the
  removal of RpSurfaceProperties from RpWorld.

  RxWorldLightingCallBack has changed from

  void RxWorldLightingCallBack(
           RwInt32 objectType,
           void *object,
           RwSurfaceProperties *surface);

  to

  void RxWorldLightingCallBack(
           RwInt32 objectType,
           void *object);


  RxPipelineNodePS2ManagerApplyLight has changed from,

  void RxPipelineNodePS2ManagerApplyLight(
           const RpLight *light,
           const RwMatrix *inverseMat,
           RwReal invScale,
           RwReal recipInvScale,
           const RwSurfaceProperties *surfaceProps);

  to

  void RxPipelineNodePS2ManagerApplyLight(
           const RpLight *light,
           const RwMatrix *inverseMat,
           RwReal invScale,
           RwReal recipInvScale);


  RxPipelineNodePS2AllApplyLight has changed from,

  void RxPipelineNodePS2AllApplyLight(
           const RpLight *light,
           const RwMatrix *inverseMat,
           RwReal invScale,
           RwReal recipInvScale,
           const RwSurfaceProperties *surfaceProps);

  to

  void RxPipelineNodePS2AllApplyLight(
           const RpLight *light,
           const RwMatrix *inverseMat,
           RwReal invScale,
           RwReal recipInvScale);

27/05/02  The following legacy API has been removed.

  RpGeometryGetSurfaceProperties
  _rpGeometryGetSurfaceProperties

  RpGeometrySetSurfaceProperties
  _rpGeometrySetSurfaceProperties

27/05/02 (PR#3498) Added an assert on the function
  _rxD3D8DefaultRenderCallback that checks if the material pointer is
  non-NULL.

27/05/02 The following legacy support macros have been removed.

  RWIMVERTEXINDEX

27/05/02 (build) added sncommon/cwcommon folder fixes and a shared folder for
  Apireference & Tuorials .chms & .chis.

24/05/02 GCN (PR#3341) Mipmap initialisation bug.

Mip levels after the first edge to reach 1 pixel in dimension were not being
initialised due to a missing clause catching zero length edges.

e.g.
Mip Level    Width    Height
    0         64        4
    1         32        2
    2         16        1
    3          8        1    Uninitialised
    4          4        1    Uninitialised
    5          2        1    Uninitialised
    6          1        1    Uninitialised

23/05/02 (build) changed packtargs to work with new build

22/05/02 (build) changed buildtarget to identify type of build in logs

21/05/02 GCN
  Removed recipz from rwGameCube2DVertex struct.

21/05/02 Xbox build machine upgraded to use the May 2002 SDK
  (build number 4531).

20/05/02 D3D8 (PR#3481) Toon plugin not using world matrix for skinned models.
  Fixed.

16/05/02 Maya Exporter - A bug has been fixed that could cause an exception
  when exporting polygons with vertices not referenced by any of the triangles
  in the polygon.

15/05/02 3ds max Exporter - Skinning Rollout in Anm exporter
  is removed since these option should not effect anm file.

15/05/02 XBOX (PR#3470) - picking example fixed.

14/05/02 3ds max Exporter - Start and End Frame settings
  We had an exception if the Start frame is equal or greater then the End
  frame. Fixed. We display an error and use Start+1 for and End frame.

14/05/02 Ptank - Sky : the resEntry was used without being checked causing
  crash when the ressource Arenna was purged/freed/trashed.
  Plus instance/swapping callback where not reseted after "official"
  instancing call

14/05/02 3ds max Exporter - Load/Save Selection buttons
  Used to crash max if there were no batch nodes in the scene. Fixed now.

14/05/02 2dconvrt (PR#3463) Export of .pngs fixed

14/05/02 PTank - PrtStd : Workaround for PR#3461 : DMA Manager was causing
  Instancing time glitches.

13/05/02 RpPVS - Fixed PR#3451.
  As such, ASSERTs no longer pop up with multiple worlds at run-time.

13/05/02 3ds max Exporter - Material color modulation
  For Standard Material we were not modulating color for bitmap textures.
  Now this applies for all textures. This is because 3ds max doesn't
  modulate material color in viewports and also because default color is
  not white so textures would always look wrong. For RwMaterial we always
  modulate the color, but since it defaults to white, it's not a problem.

13/05/02 3ds max Exporter - Export Object in World Space option
  Was set by default when Add Node or Auto Create Nodes buttons
  were used, but was off when node was just switched to dff/anm
  type. Now it's always on by default.

13/05/02 3ds max Exporter - Preserve Normals option
  in material settings rollout was ignored. Removed now. So if Export
  2-Sided Materials option is turned on for all geometry that has
  2-Sided Materials, vertices and triangles will be duplicated, and
  normals flipped for right shading.

13/05/02 3ds max Exporter - Cropping for all textures in RwMaterial.
  Support for cropping in RwMaterial is added. Have in mind that cropping
  in 3ds max is per bitmap information, and in RW is per material per UV
  set information, so things will go wrong if two textures in the same
  material using the same UV set, have crop applied on one of them. We will
  put an error message in such case in Warning dialog, but continue export.
  Another thing is cropping will affect your tristripping if you use tiled
  texture. A warning for that is displayed too.
  Also Apply option in Bitmap crop settings was ignored, fixed now.

13/05/02 3ds max Exporter - Warning dialog bug fix.
  If the option Display Report was turned off, and there are some errors,
  dialog would appear, but except the icons it would be empty. Fixed now
  and dialog will appear with just errors.

10/05/02 PTANK : Capital R in front of ALL functions/typedef

10/05/02 PTANK : 2d texcoordinates where not matching all the platforms

10/05/02 PTANK : Published custom ptank creation stealth function

10/05/02 PTANK : Replace 0 check in the custom render callback by a couple of
  assert, and updated the examples accordingly

10/05/02 GCN (PR#3426) RwRasterLock when locking rasters of type
  rwRASTERTYPECAMERATEXTURE was not invalidating the pixel memory from DCache.

10/05/02 GCN (PR#3430) Loading and rendering pre-instanced skinned geometries
  would invoke the instancing code causing it to crash due to a missing flag
  check.

09/05/02 D3D8 (PR#3453) Video memory wasted on palettes.
  Now available palette numbers are used in a more efficient way.

08/05/02 (PR#3292) RwRasterGetStride now asserts if the rasters pixels have
  not been locked.

08/05/02 PS2All Im3D pipeline changes
  Prior to the DMA system changes (of 28/04/02), the largest instanced Im3D
  primitive supported on PS2 was 64k. This necessitated painfully slow
  primitive splitting behind the scenes. As this restriction no longer
  applies (the maximum instanced block allocation can now be increased
  by calling _rwDMAPreAlloc before RwEngineStart), the primitive-splitting
  code has been removed from the PS2All pipeline architecture (it still
  remains in the PS2Manager code, as its status is now 'legacy code'). This
  may result in a code size reduction and a (CPU-side) Im3D rendering
  performance increase. In addition to this, the following items have been
  removed from the API:
    o RxPipelineNodePS2AllMatIm3DPreMeshCallBack,
    o RxPipelineNodePS2AllMatIm3DPostMeshCallBack,
    o RxPipelineNodePS2AllMatIm3DMeshSplitCallBack,
    o _rwIm3DPS2AllIm3DPreMeshCallBack,
    o _rwIm3DPS2AllIm3DPostMeshCallBack,
    o _rwIm3DPS2AllMeshSplitCallBack,
    o rxPS2ALLMATCALLBACKIM3DMESHSPLIT,
    o rxPS2ALLMATCALLBACKIM3DPOSTMESH,
    o rxPS2ALLMATCALLBACKIM3DPREMESH
    o _rwIm3DPS2AllMeshEnd
  Additionally, RwIm3DPS2AllPostMeshCallBack is now only required during
  an RWMETRICS build.

07/05/02 3ds max Exporter - Start and End frame support in DFF/ANM exporter.

07/05/02 3ds max Exporter - Custom attributes fix.
  If the custom attributes were not setup right the exporter could've crash.
  Fixed now.

07/05/02 3ds max Exporter - Vertices with different normals were duplicated
  in the exporter even if the normals were not exported. That would usually
  affect the prelight colors. Fixed now.

03/05/02 RtImport and SectorEditor fixes:
  RtImport: Asserts that maxWorldSectorPolygons and maxWorldSectorSize are
  greater than zero.
  Space culling respects hints.
  SectorEditor: maxWorldSectorPolygons and maxWorldSectorSize now can't be set
  zero or below.
  PVS generation on an empty world crash fixed.

03/05/02 OpenGL RpAnisot
  Added support for anisotropic filtering to OpenGL via the extension
  GL_EXT_texture_filter_anisotropic. This affects PC and Mac implementations.
  Included rpanisot as a valid plugin to build for OpenGL in the top-level
  makefile.

03/05/02 RtImport
  GuideKDtree child order flag was set incorrectly.

02/05/02 Visualizer (PR#3384) Changed place where reg keys are stored from
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE to HKEY_CURRENT_USER to allow users without admin
  priviledges to run the visualizer.

01/05/02 D3D8 (PR#3424) resizing the windows in an example.
  Changed to restore current cached values for alpha renderstates when doing
  a device reset.

01/05/02 Binary revision number bumped to 3.4.0.00

01/05/02 OpenGL
  Extension query function _rwOpenGLIsExtensionSupported() upgraded to
  API status with a name change to RwOpenGLIsExtensionSupported() and
  documented. Structure RwGlVertex changed to RwOpenGLVertex and documented.

  Debug output upon calling RwEngineStart() has been changed to correctly
  format ALL supported extensions by the OpenGL implementation. Also, for Win
  and Mac drivers, information about the pixel format selected by the driver
  is output.

30/04/02 Xbox (PR#3419) rxXbAtomicMatFXEnvRender, prelit and material colour.
  Using pixel shaders to modulate the diffuse color by the material color
  before adding the envmap texture.

30/04/02 GCN (PR#3418) RwCameraClear did not restore fog state correctly.

  On GameCube, RwCameraClear disabled fog but did not restore the setting
  again once finished. Later calls to rwRENDERSTATEFOGENABLE had no effect
  because fog was already enabled according to the cache.

29/04/02 (PR#3411) NULL Xbox calculates incorrectly the number of mip levels,
  fixed.

29/04/02 (PR#3409) D3D8 crashes when calling RwRasterGetNumLevels for a raster
  created with rwRASTERDONTALLOCATE, fixed.

29/04/02 GCN (PR#3407)
   RwRasterGetNumLevels returns 1 to few if, a raster is created with
   rwRASTERDONTALLOCATE and then RwRasterGetNumLevels is called.

29/04/02 GCN
  Added an assert into RwGameCubeTextureSetLOD that warns about the addressing
  mode on non power of two sized textures.

29/04/02 (PR#3404) Xbox prelight with material and lights: the material colour
  was not modulating the prelight and texture correctly when lights are used.

29/04/02 3ds max Exporter - "Filter Through Top-Level Biped Keys" bug fix.
  This option didn't add keyframes from the biped root node to the rest of
  biped nodes which resulted in wrong animation. Fixed now. Also removed
  warnings if this function doesn't find all biped nodes.

28/04/02 PS2 Dma system
  The dma manager has been replaced with a more efficient version that uses
  fewer interrupts and doen't do dynamic memory allocation. If you do not
  use the dma mamnager, you need merely remove any references to "sweMaxFlips"
  from your code (now hard coded to be 0), replace references to "sweDb"
  and "tcaaDisp" with suitable members of _rwDMAFlipData, and change the
  call to _swePreAlloc to _rwDMAPreAlloc (note the argument changes) to update.
  If you do use the dma manager, for example in your own pipelines, you should
  obtain a copy of dma.pdf from support.

27/04/02 GCN
  Changed RwRasterCreate to allocate a texture of the desired depth if no
  explicit pixel format is specified. 4 & 8 bit rasters will not allocate
  a palette if not explicitly requested.

26/04/02 OpenGL public variable name change to uphold coding standards:
  * (Win32) PixelFormatDesc -> _rwOpenGLPixelFormatDesc

  This has now been made deterministic - so identical worlds will now produce
  identical BSPs.

24/04/02 3ds max Exporter - Add Node and Auto Create Nodes bug fix.
  In some cases when a scene was just loaded or a modifier applied, etc, these
  functions would get a validity interval from max to be [0, 0] and they would
  create a dff node even though an object is static. Fixed now.

24/04/02 RtImport - bug fix.
  If RtWorldImportCreateWorld is called without setting a scheme or terminator
  these are now set to default and subsequently set back to NULL. This fixes
  a problem that occurred when no scheme was set and the world was built more
  than once.

23/04/02 3ds max Exporter - Number of references bug fix.
  Number of references in batch exporter nodes used to increase every time
  Save Selection button was used. Fixed now.

18/04/02 3ds max Exporter - Auto Create Nodes
  Fixed a problem where a BSP node could be created containing only non-
  renderable objects. This node would then fail to export.

18/04/02 Xbox - RpSkin could incorrectly scale skins when rendering with
 D3DMULTISAMPLE_4_SAMPLES_MULTISAMPLE_LINEAR and building against March XDK or
 later.  Now fixed, but requires lib to be built against April XDK.

17/04/02 Xbox - Upgraded to April XDK (Build 4432)

  rwsdk/plugin/logo/rplogo.c

15/04/02 Max Exporter
  - "Save HAnim Hierarchy" option is now turned on by default for skinned
    hierarchies.
  - Env and Bump Map values in RwMaterials are no longer limited to 1.0,
    the limit is set to 100.0
  - If "Add Node" button fails to setup the options for the node, a message
    box will be displayed and a dff node with default options will be created.
  - Exporter would in some cases try to export to rws file even if there are
    batch exporter nodes used before rws was introduced. Fixed.

15/04/02 PS2 Sony libs update
  Now building against 2.5 to enable DTV480p support.

15/04/02 Max Exporter
  - "Scale By" factor in bsp options was ignored when size of the world was

12/04/02 GCN RpCrowd: (PR#3345) fixed a problem with negative UVs in crowd
  quads.

12/04/02 Max Exporter - named selection sets for edges should be prefixed with
  "silhouette_" or "crease_" and appropriate type of ink will be set.

12/04/02 Visualizer control panel cpu usage
  Reduced the cpu usage when the visualizer control panel is idling. This
  should make other applications more responsive whilst the visualizer is
  running.

12/04/02 Maya Exporter - Extended Support for toon shader.
  Maya edge selection sets are supported and ink with the name of the maya set
  will be set for those edges. Selection set names have to be prefixed with
  "silhouette_" or "crease_" and appropriate type of ink will be set.
  Maya blind data is used for setting the weights for the toon shader on
  vertices.
  Blind Data template has to be named "RpToon", vertex for association type,
  double for data type and "VertexThickness" should be the long attribute name.
  Values should be in 0.0 to 1.0 range.
  RwMaterial is extended with the paint name. The name from the batch exporter
  node settings will be used if the option is not enabled.

12/04/02 Ptank plugin - Spr2dgen particles was twice as big as it should be

  Fixed a problem where the clip planes would be incorrectly set after
  resizing a PC viewer window.

10/04/02 Visualizer Viewer
  Fixed a problem where texture dictionaries were freed up before the assets
  which potentially use them. If new textures were created and added to the
  dictionary during loading it would cause crashes on exit of the viewer. This
  was known to happen for bump maps exported from Maya.

10/04/02 Visualizer Viewer
  Unified the world and atomic rendering of tristrips, meshes etc. This
  reduces code space overhead in the viewer.

10/04/02 Bug fix. Fixed Color and UVs interpolation bug in rpprtstd. -ve

10/04/02 Updated the Glossary pdf from Glossary doc (they were out of step)

10/04/02 PS2: Codewarrior problem with Renderware (PR#3300)
  Use only the local extent RWFORCEENUMSIZEINT within enum definitions
  to force 4 byte enums, rather than a global extent pragma in rwcore.h.
  A pragma is unneccessary since ANSI C enums should be no wider than an int
  (see section 3.1.3.4 in ANSI C rationale). A global pragma in rwcore.h
  also applies to application as well as RW enums, which can be undesirable
  e.g. if some application files includes rwcore.h but others do not
  leading to a mismatch in enum sizes.

09/04/02 Visualizer
  Added new controls on the control panel enabling the user to set the
  sensitivity of the movement controls in the viewer.

09/04/02 Visualizer Viewer

  Graphics for D3D8 remains compatible with the DirectX8.0 SDK.

11/03/02 Max Exporters - Add Node button.
  Automatic detection of the exporter type and the settings used for "Auto
  Create Nodes" button is now used for "Add Node" button also, so the options
  and the exporter correctly set. Again have in mind that the algorithm 
  doesn't cover all export settings you might want to use.

10/03/02 Win (D3D8 and OpenGL) MCP files have been generated for examples and
  viewers using the CodeWarrior 7 for Windows IDE. These are denoted by

  to run on GDEV. For DHH the setting in,

  GAMECUBE HW2 Dbg/Rel Settings
  Target Settings Panels
      Debugger
          GCN Debugger Setting
          Protocol

  Must be changed from MetroTRK - GDEV to MetroTRK - GameOptix.


  The MCPs now use a Source Tree environment variable, RWSDK, that must be set
  in the IDE.

  From the menu select:

    Edit
    Preference
        IDE Preferences Panels
        General
            Source Trees

  and add RWSDK.

08/03/02 D3D8 - Changed the behavior of the texture dictionary load.
  Now it fails if a raster can not be created because the pixel format or
  the texture dimensions are not supported by the video card.
  Added a stealth function "_rwD3D8TexDictionaryEnableRasterFormatConversion"
  to enable texture conversions on the fly.

  is compatible with RenderWare lightmap generation. This support is enabled
  through an option available in both the dff and bsp geometry settings.

15/02/02 (PR#2948) RwRasterClearRect wrong RWASSERT
  The following asserts:
    RWASSERT((rect->x + rect->w) < RwRasterGetWidth(curRaster));
    RWASSERT((rect->y + rect->h) < RwRasterGetHeight(curRaster));
  should be:
    RWASSERT((rect->x + rect->w) <= RwRasterGetWidth(curRaster));
    RWASSERT((rect->y + rect->h) <= RwRasterGetHeight(curRaster));

14/02/02 GCN (PR#2946) Modifying positions or normal arrays now forces
  GXInvalidateVtvCache to be called keeping vertex cache coherency.

14/02/02 GCN Compressed vertex support added into RpSKin.

  IMPORTANT:
  The pre-instance binary format has been broken for skinned geometry's.
  All pre-instanced skinned geometry's will have to be regenerated.

13/02/02 3ds max exporter - Auto Create Nodes
  Fixed a problem where this would not work from the floating window interface
  to the batch exporter.

13/02/02 PVSCNVRT tool does not require textures for the world to be present
  The tool overloads the texture read callback so texture information is
  retained.

12/02/02 GCN (PR#2943) VIInit was not being called before all other VI
  functions.  This was causing VIGetTvFormat to return the wrong format.

  The call to VIInit has been removed from RenderWare Graphics and must be
  called by the application. See \shared\skel\gcn.c for an example of usage.

12/02/02 3ds max exporter - Parameter Wiring
  Basic support for parameter wiring in 3ds max 4 has now been added. Where a
  controller is wired to one or more other controllers, keyframes will be
  sampled from all the linked controllers.

12/02/02 (PR#2942) Maestro 2dconvrt would sometimes crash when trying to read
 a font. This was because a raster format was not specified correctly.

11/02/02 GCN New API functions,

    RwGameCubeSetCopyClear
    RwGameCubeGetCopyClear

11/02/02 3ds max exporter bug fix
  Fixed a problem where an export would fail if no materials were assigned to
  an object. The bug was introduced with the changes to RpUserData export on
  07/02/02.

11/02/02 GCN New API functions,

    RwGameCubeRasterSetRegion
    RwGameCubeRasterGetRegion
    RwGameCubeTextureSetLOD
    RwGameCubeTextureGetLOD
    RwGameCubePreLoadEntireTexture
    RwGameCubeTextureSetPreLoaded
    RwGameCubeTextureGetPreLoaded

    Modified RwGameCubeCameraTextureFlush to return void and changed behaviour
    if a region has been assigned.

07/02/02 3ds max Exporter - Project configuration
  The 3ds max exporter has now got Hybrid build targets which replace the old
  Debug build targets, the Debug build targets are now setup for people who
  wish to develop against Debug builds of 3ds max. To use these configurations
  setup new environment variables of MAX3DEBUG_INSTALL_DIR or 
  MAX4DEBUG_INSTALL_DIR to point at the location of the debug 3dsmax.exe

07/02/02 3ds max Exporter - RwMaterial properties renamed
  A number of GCN/Xbox specific settings in RwMaterials had matching names,
  this meant that they were not properly accessible through maxscript. The
  clashing names have been changed to avoid clashes, e.g on gcn settings
	effect_file -> gcn_effect_file
	texmap_texture0 -> gcn_texture0
	texmap_texture1 -> gcn_texture1 etc
  and on Xbox settings
	effect_file -> xbox_effect_file
	texmap_texture0 -> xbox_texture0
	texmap_texture1 -> xbox_texture1 etc


07/02/02 3ds max Exporter - Changes to texture processing
  The texture processing has been reworked in the exporter to allow future
  support for writing out platform independent texture dictionaries.

07/02/02 3ds max Exporter - Changes to RpUserData export
  The 3ds max exporter now supports specially formatted custom attributes
  on lights, cameras, textures, materials, geometries, vertices and polygons.
  This data is supported both in the bsp and dff exporters.
  (This functionality is not yet documented and hence not recommended for use.
   It will be fully documented by the 3.3 release)

07/02/02 Maya Exporter - Scene Settings implementation and .rws file format.
  - RenderWare Editor changes are:  1. Multiple columns and 2. resizable 
    scroll list and other controls.
  - New button and menu entry "Scene Settings" will popup a window with
    options for exporting to .rws (RenderWare Scene) file and for exporting a
    texture dictionary (that feature is still in development). If "Export all
    nodes to .rws file" option is enabled, all binary data/chunks that were
    previously stored in anm, bsp, dff, dma, spl file, will end up in one rws
    file. "Export All Nodes" button will in this case export all
    RenderWareExport nodes to the rws file, and "Export Highlighted Nodes" 
    will process only the highlighted nodes in the editor. In first case 
    chunks will be ordered alphabetically using node names, and in second case
    in order in which they are displayed in the editor.
  - Progress bar works now on per export basis, so even if you export several
    dffs and a bsp it will go from 0 to 100 only one time.
  - RenderWareExport command now takes RenderWareExport node names for its
    arguments. You can supply as many argument (node names) as you need.
  - Some processing is now done only once when exporting multiple nodes, which
    makes export of many RenderWare nodes faster.

06/02/02 GCN (PR#2932) Cache coherency problems with matFX perturbed UVs
  for bump mapping fixed.

05/02/02 Maya Exporter - changes to RpUserData export
  The Maya exporter now exports blind data on lights, cameras, shaders
  and textures to RpUserData. Since the Maya blind data editor does
  not support these object types the data must be added through MEL
  script. The blind data section of the Maya Artist Guide describes
  how to do this.

05/02/02 Changes to RpUserData plugin
  This plugin had been been extended to support user data on RwCamera,
  RpLight, RpMaterial and RwTexture objects. The plugin has also been
  changed to prevent any data being streamed if no user data has been
  added. The plugin is still compatible with earlier data.

05/02/02 (PR#2927) Xbox skinmatx envmapping bug fixed
  Files changed:
	plugin/skin2/xbox/skinxboxmatfx.c

05/02/02 Xbox driver consolidation
Removed _rwXbRenderStateTexture and promoted _rwXbRenderStateSetTexture
to API : RwXboxRenderStateSetTexture

05/02/02 GCN Upgraded to use CodeWarrior 1.3.

04/02/02 - (PR#2917) Tons of asserts .. ASSERTPOSITIVEORTHONORMAL
Removed RWASSERTPOSITIVEORTHONORMAL() macros from
rwsdk/plugin/hanim/rphanim.c
since the assertions these make are no longer valid.
Changelist #43904

04/02/02 Xbox - Added Lazy State Cache
D3D Render state and Texture stage state are now cached in a lazy manner
(i.e. only updated when necessary). The RwRenderState caching is unchanged,
so the behaviour of RwGetRenderState is consistent with previous versions.
Users developing custom pipeline must change the following D3D calls

D3DDevice_SetRenderState -> RwXboxSetCachedRenderState
D3DDevice_GetRenderState -> RwXboxGetCachedRenderState
D3DDevice_SetTextureStageState -> RwXboxSetCachedTextureStageState
D3DDevice_GetTextureStageState -> RwXboxGetCachedTextureStageState
D3DDevice_SetTexture -> RwXboxSetCachedTexture
D3DDevice_GetTexture -> RwXboxSetCachedTexture
D3DDevice_DrawIndexedVertices -> RwXboxDrawIndexedVertices
D3DDevice_DrawIndexedVerticesUP -> RwXboxDrawIndexedVerticesUP
D3DDevice_DrawVertices -> RwXboxDrawVertices
D3DDevice_DrawVerticesUP -> RwXboxDrawVerticesUP
D3DDevice_SetRenderTarget -> RwXboxSetRenderTarget
o
For more information on the lazy state cache and the new API, please consult
the Xbox User Guide and API reference.

31/01/02 (PR#2916) D3D8 - Identical lights not recognized
  Now, each RpLight has an index to a D3D8 light, so all of them are unique
  and can share the same space without any problem. But, the current
  implementation of DirectX seems to have an internal limit in the number of
  lights created although it is a high number: 2048 lights for T&L video cards
  (don't confuse that with the maximum number of active lights).

  Also, two new functions have been added to the RWD3D8 API:
  * RpD3D8LightSetAttenuationParams
  * RpD3D8LightGetAttenuationParams
  They are very similar to the RWD3D7 ones.

  Files changed:
	driver\d3d8\d3d8device.c
	world\pipe\p2\d3d8\d3d8lights.h
	world\pipe\p2\d3d8\d3d8lights.c

	world\pipe\p2\d3d8\worlddoc.c

31/01/02 GCN prelit alpha objects - alpha is no longer affected by dynamic
  lights Previously the dynamic lights made prelit alpha objects more opaque.

31/01/02 RwXbox prelit static objects with dynamic lighting & vertex alpha
  Previously, the vertex alpha was ignored in this case, now it's used,
  and has been brought into line with the behaviour of RwD3D8.

31/01/02 PVS plugin - Header files rearranged
  pvscnvrt failed because some typedefs were misplaced - they are now placed
  correctly, and made stealth where necessary, to avoid conflicts.

31/01/02 GCN RenderWare Graphics for GameCube can now be used with SN Systems
  ProDG for Nintendo GameCube.

  rwsdk/bin/patchlibsetjmp.exe must first be run on rtpng.a if using
  RenderWare Graphics for GameCube with SN Systems ProDG for Nintendo
  GameCube.

  e.g.
      /* From the command line type */
      patchlibsetjmp rtpng.a

31/01/02 PVS plugin - Bug fix
  Fixed detessellator, should now work better for scene with bizarre geometry.

30/01/02 Maya Exporter - Changes UV limiting
  The UV limiting functionality in the Maya exporter has been changed to an
  algorithm with upper and lower bounds (as used in the 3ds max exporter).
  The UV limiting and shifting settings in existing export nodes will now be
  ignored.

30/01/02 3ds max Exporter - Fix for UV limiting
  The previous code for UV limiting was not always generating UV's within the
  limits specified. This has been fixed with a new algorithm.

30/01/02 Null driver - RwImageSetFromRaster
  The Null driver would previously crash if you pass an already locked
  RwRaster into RwImageSetFromRaster. This has been corrected.

29/01/02 3ds max Exporter - New batch exporter feature
  The 3ds max batch exporter now has a new button marked "Auto Create Nodes"
  which processes all the data in the current 3ds max scene and generates a
  set of batch export nodes for the scene.
  Note: Not all exporter options are modified for the new set of nodes (e.g.
  tristrip methods are left to the user).

28/01/02 Xbox mipmap levels
  Now a mipmapped raster can contain less mipmap levels than the maximum.
  ie. a 256x256 texture can now contain 2 mipmap levels.
  Xbox texture dictionaries will need rebuilding.

28/01/02 Maya Exporter - Dff Exporter.
  "Coordinate System" option in the dff exporter is set to "World" now by
  default.

28/01/02 Maya Exporter - Bsp Exporter.
  Bsp exporting was very slow at the start when initialising data in large
  scenes and working with selected objects only. Fixed now.

28/01/02 3ds max exporter skinning support
  The skinning support in 3ds max has been rewritten to be more generic. This
  means that all types of skinned objects (currently Physique, Max Skin and
  Bones Pro) will act exactly the same. A few minor behavioral changes occur
  because of this as listed.
  1. There is now only a single option to enable skinned exports, this enables
     support for all three types of skinning.
  2. HAnim node id's for biped objects will always use the predefined set of
     id's set out in the exporter code. Previously this only occured when
     Physique skins were used.
  3. Where a skinned object is within the hierarchy representing it's skeleton
     in 3ds max it is moved to the root of the exported clump. Previously
     except when using Physique an RwFrame and HAnim node were still created 
     where it was originally located. This extra RwFrame and node are now
     removed for all types of skinning.

28/01/02 Xbox SSE optimized RwMatrixMultiply
  You should find this version much faster than the generic C version it
  it is replacing. It is also about 30% faster than the hand optimized scalar
  FPU version we use on PC, and slightly faster than the Xbox SDK's own 4x4
  matrix multiply as RwMatrixMultiply does 4x3 matrices.
  Note however that it destroys the pad values in RwMatrix which you should
  NOT have been using anyway!
  Files changed:
    rwsdk\driver\xbox\drvmodel.h

28/01/02 Maya Exporter - Renamings.
  rwTriangulate command is renamed into RenderWareTriangulate.
  RenderWareProcessScene command has the same name, but a menu entry is
  renamed into "Auto Create Nodes". Also a button in the RenderWare Editor is
  added.

28/01/02 Maya Exporter - New RenderWareProcessScene command
  is added. It will process the scene and automatically create all
  RenderWareExport nodes and set the settings. It doesn't cover all the 
  options in the exporters so you should check the setting if you have some 
  special needs, but it should work in the majority of cases. Also the same 
  algorithm is used by the Add Node button.

25/01/02 (PR#2908) D3D8 explicitly sets srcAlpha, invSrcAlpha
  Now the default pipelines don't explicitly set the blending modes.
  Files changed:
    world\pipe\p2\d3d8\d3d8pipe.c
    world\pipe\p2\d3d8\d3d8pipe.h
    plugin\matfx\d3d8\effectPipesD3D8.c

25/01/02 Win OpenGL pixel format descriptor (PixelFormatDesc) is now globally
  accessible.

24/01/02 Maya Exporter - Vertices are now remapped by maya vertex index first.
  This means, even if two vertices have the same position, normals, UVs and
  prelights, if they are different in maya (have different maya vertex index)),
  they will be exported as two vertices. This will fix some bugs with skinning
  and morphing.

24/01/02 Maya Exporter - Two options are now turned on by default:
  "Export Blind Data" and "Disable UV shifting". The first option will not 
  have any effect on the files exported if the scene doesn't have any  maya
  blind data templates.

23/01/02 Light and camera export from 3ds max
  Support for export of lights and cameras has been added to the 3ds max dff
  exporter. There are no new export options in the user interface. Any lights
  or cameras in the export hierarchy will be added to the clump. Both
  perspective and orthographic cameras are supported as are directional, 
  point, spot and soft spot lights. Currently all cameras require manual clip
  planes defining, those cameras without manually defined clip planes will 
  take default RenderWare clip planes. Soft spot lights are defined by 3ds max 
  spot lights where the falloff angle and hotspot angle differ by more than 5
  degrees.

23/01/02 (PR#2845) RpAtomicClone crashes with RpMorph data
  RpInterpolatorSet* was not checking the atomic's frame before calling
  RwFrameUpdateObjects.

23/01/02 Light and camera export from Maya
  Support for export of lights and cameras has been added to the Maya dff
  exporter. There are no new export options in the user interface. Any lights
  or cameras in the export hierarchy will be added to the clump. Both 
  perspective and orthographic cameras are supported as are ambient, 
  directional, point and spot lights.

22/01/02 New RpCollis API functions added
  RpCollisionGeometryQueryData() and RpCollisionGeometryDestroyData() have
  been added to mirror the existing functions 
  RpCollisionWorldSectorQueryData() and RpCollisionWorldSectorDestroyData()

21/01/02 GCN upgraded to use December SDK.

18/01/02 Maya Exporter - Removal of the File->Export method of exporting.
  The File->Export methods of exporting are no longer supported and will now
  simply point you to the RenderWare Editor, accessible through the RenderWare
  menu. The RenderWare Exporter is now a command plugin and can be called from
  the custom mel script interface.

17/01/02 (PR#2881) Xbox RwRasterUnlock with 
  rwRASTERTYPECAMERA/rwRASTERTYPEZBUFFER crashed because it was calling 
  D3DResource_Release when it shouldn't have.
  Files changed:
	rwsdk\driver\xbox\xbraster.c

17/01/02 Example Documents  added to dev\doc\Examples
  Added Word documents of the RW Examples to go out to users. One document is
  "ExamplesGeneric", the other 4 are platform-specific. They are converted to
  pdfs.

16/01/02 Maya Exporter - Bug fixes for nurbs surfaces.
  place2dTexture node was ignored, fixed now. Also fixed a bug in destructor
  that could lead to an exception. UV coordinates were wrong if the 
  parameterisation for the surface was not starting from zero. Fixed.

16/01/02 3ds max Exporter - User Interface redesign
  The user interface of the 3ds max exporter has been redesigned to ease use
  of the batch export functionality of the exporter. The batch exporter now
  supports all export types (previously spline export was excluded). The 
  interface can now be used as a floating dialog under 3ds max 4 accessible 
  through a new RenderWare menu bar. The export settings dialogs have been 
  reorganised into categorized groups set out in 3ds max style rollup windows.
  The methods of exporting through the File->Export interface are no longer
  supported and will now simply point you to the batch exporter.
  The chm based online help has also been removed with tooltips replacing the 
  context sensitive help and a link to the RenderWare Artist Guide for 3ds max
  provided in the RenderWare menu.

15/01/02 Maya Exporter - command line batch export.
  RenderWareBatch mel function has been split into two functions:
  RenderWareNodeExport and RenderWareBatchExport.
  The first one takes one argument which can be:
  "-h" - export highlighted (selected in RenderWare Editor) RenderWareExport
         nodes,
  "-s" - export selected RenderWareExport nodes,
  "-a" - export all RenderWareExport nodes,
  The second function "RenderWareBatchExport" will load all maya scenes from
  a specified folder and export all RenderWareExport nodes from each scene. It
  takes two arguments. The first one is a boolean value specifying recursion
  and the second one is a path of a folder containing the scenes. If it is an
  empty string, a dialog will be displayed for browsing a folder. For example 
  to export scenes from a command line you can execute one of these commands:
  mayabatch -command "RenderWareBatchExport 1 \"C:/MayaScenes\""
  maya -batch -command "RenderWareBatchExport 1 \"C:/MayaScenes\""

14/01/02 GCN Modifed the token code to call GXReadDrawSync rather that
  installing a callback to allow the performance libs to work.

14/01/02 RpClump extended to contain lights and cameras. These are
  streamed as part of the clump and automatically added to (or
  removed from worlds) with the clump.
  New API: RpClumpAddLight, RpClumpRemoveLight, RpClumpGetNumLights,
  RpClumpForAllLights, RpLightGetClump and similarly for cameras.

  The 3.2 archived plugins and any archive plugin dependancies have been
  removed. This includes Anim, PVS310, Skin310, Prtsys, Matfx310 and
  the tool Hanimcnv.

08/01/02 Archived exporters removed from the build
  The 3.2 archived exporters (supporting 3.1 functionality) have been removed
  from the build.

08/01/02 RenderWare version number increment
  The CurrentLibraryVersion has been increased from 3.2 to 3.3 to reflect
  the 3.3 development tree.

21/12/01 3dsmax Exporter - two bug fixes
  With hidden skins and physique using max bones.

21/12/01 Maya Exporter - RenderWare menu implementation.
  RenderWare menu is added. Options included are:
  - RenderWare Editor,
  - Export All Nodes,
  - Export Maya Files From Directory,
  - Export Maya Files From Directory Recursively,
  - rwTriangulate command.

21/12/01 (PR#2849) OpenGL restarts in same application instance, fix
  Static variables were not being reinitialized causing the video selection
  dialog to display incorrect and the OpenGL camera clear function to use
  an incorrectly cached color.

  Pixel/texel alignment needed to be adjusted.
  Files changed:
	tool/charse/chrprint.c

19/12/01 (PR#2842) OpenGL texture lost in camera SDK example fix
  This problem arose when certain conditions surrounding camera textures were
  apparent. Briefly, the texture bound to OGL would differ from that cached by
  RenderWare Graphics causing texture binding to be skipped. The fix was to
  invalidate the cached texture reference when the bound texture changed due 
  to the use of camera textures.

	driver/opengl/drvfns.h

18/12/01 (PR#2841) RpWorldInstance would try and preinstance worlds that were
  already in native form. RpWorldInstance now has the same behaviour as
  RpAtomicInstance and returns TRUE if the world is already in native form.
      files changed: baworld.c

17/12/01 PS2 (PR#2840) _rpWorldSectorSkyFreeResEntry/
  _rpGeometrySkyFreeResEntry weren't checking that repEntry != NULL causing a
  crash if instancing was attempted before the worldsector/atomic was
  rendered.

14/12/01 Maya Exporter - rwTriangulate command
  - This new command works as the Polygons -> Triangulate maya command,
  except it will align all new edges in the best way possible for
  tri-stripping. Have in mind that for perfect tri-stripping, vertices have to
  share: normals, UVs and prelights. It works only on quads, so in ideal case
  you would do modelling in quads and use this command to turn them into
  triangles before exporting.
  - rwTriangulate command should be typed in the Command Line and 
  alternatively you can, before pressing the Enter key, drag the text to the 
  shelf to create an icon. 
  - Command works with multiple selections of objects or polygons.
  - If you get a warning: "// Warning: line 1: polyFlipEdge: Cannot flip edge
  xxxx, contained by a concave quad //" it is because of the polyFlipEdge maya
  bug. It should not hit more then 5% of edges that actually need to be
  flipped (much less then the whole number of object edges), so even if this
  occurs, the tri-stripping will still significantly improve. This is reported
  to the A|W and hopefully will be fixed in the next main or intermediate 
  (dot) release.

14/12/01 PS2 World View
  Added toggle for tristrip clipper to menu.

13/12/01 3dsmax Exporter - Vertex Color
  Added support for vertex color (prelight) alpha and illumination values.
  Material self-illumination values are still baked into the prelight colors.
  Vertex color alpha and illumination values are a max4.0 feature.

13/12/01 3ds max Exporter - BSP batch exports
  Fixed a problem where selections were being ignored and the whole scene
  was always being exported.

12/12/01 Maya Exporter - Multiple UV sets bug fix
  A workaround has been added for a maya bug which could cause multiple
  UV sets to be ignored and all textures would just use the first UV set. The
  workaround was possible only in maya4.0 not maya3.0

12/12/01 PS2 (PR#2827) RwUInt64, RwInt64 and ProDG
  RwUInt64 and RWInt64 where not correctly defined when using SN's port of
  the 2.95.3 compiler.

11/12/01 GCN - Display list creation was over allocating by 64 bytes.

11/12/01 D3D8 - Added a faster SSE version of the Skin plugin. If the
  compiler doesn't support inline SSE assembler you can specify NOSSEASM
  to disable it.

10/12/01 Bin Tools. A subset of the the original bin tools from
  rwsdk\bin exist in the source deliverable. The majority have been
  removed for size and other reasons. These bin tools are available as
  as a zip download if required.

10/12/01 PS2 (PR#2809) - the maximum number of mip levels was not being
  correctly set when reading textures from a texture dictionary, causing
  image corruption. Files updated:
      dev\rwsdk\driver\sky2\basky.c

05/12/01 Maya Exporter - Nurbs material fix
  A bug has been fixed that could cause an exception during dff exports of
  hierarchies containing a mixture of polygon and nurbs shapes which
  share a material with no textures.

05/12/01 Compressed texture attributes in RwTexture to take up 1/3 the space.
