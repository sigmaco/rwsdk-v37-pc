13/06/02  Examples: the .c .h and .txt files have been standardised - 
          matching, updated copyright headers and second headers. 
          Programmer's names replaced by RenderWare Team as the Author.
          American spelling all(?) removed - the whole lot scanned with
          Word's spell checker - standard terms, spelling and case applied
          to the names of menu-options and commands. A consistent order
          applied to them. Missing Purpose: descriptions added and old
          ones tidied up in all three file types. General tidying up of 
          the language in extreme cases. House-style applied to about
          fifty variant hyphenations, captialisations and spellings. RogerB

          Cel, Dual-pass rendering, Fill-rate, G3, GPU, Maya, Mel script,
          Mesh, Modeling Package, Object (OO or world item), Opaque
          (function/struct), Patch Mesh, PNG, ROI, slerp, TIFF, Transparent
          (funct/struct), Visualizer and Voxel. RogerB.

07/06/02 User Guide, Chapter 3, Intialization and Resource Managment. 
          I replaced the "Note:" at the end of section 3.3.3 with a note
          saying "RwResourcesSetArenaSize() now determines the size the
          Resource Arena, which is a single block of allocated memory.
          This will free the current resource arena heap, if one exists,
          and allocate a new heap."
          This functionality changed in Feb *2001*. RogerB

06/06/02 Updated all the .txt files of the published examples, and checked 
          their .c and .h files for (c) notices, headers, American Spelling
          etc etc. Checked the order and accuracy of controls and                     menu options. (Can't fully check the platform-specific variations
          but compared with the code of some of them.)  RogerB
