     RenderWare Graphics Viewer Program (win): World viewer
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

PURPOSE

The WRLDVIEW application may be used to load and explore BSP worlds.

To load a world, the BSP file can be dragged-and-dropped onto the window
or entered in the file "wrldview.ini" located in the same directory as 
the BSP file. On startup the viewer reads the "wrldview.ini" file and 
loads the specified BSP file. If multiple files are listed only the 
first one is loaded and the rest are ignored.

When a world is loaded, the viewer will look for a texture dictionary
file (TXD) in the same directory as the BSP file. As there are platform
dependencies, the texture dictionary file must be identified as such,
and it is assumed that the file name includes "_d3d8" for D3D8, "_ogl"
for OpenGL, etc. So, for example, the texture dictionary file for a BSP 
called "world.bsp" running on D3D8 should be called "world_d3d8.txd". If 
no texture dictionary file is available, textures are loaded from 
individual image files, and it is assumed the image files reside in a 
directory located with the BSP which is either named according to the 
BSP's name or is simply called "textures". Texture dictionaries can be 
saved from the viewer to a disk file using the naming convention 
described above.

The viewer also looks for a SPL file in the same directory as the world 
which contains a RW spline path. It is assummed the spline has the same 
name has the world. If a spline file is found, it is loaded and may be 
used as the basis of all camera navigation. If no spline is found and 
loaded, the camera can be navigated freely within the world.

The viewer can be used to generate PVS data for the world and the PVS 
data can be saved out to a new BSP file. A generic method for the
calculation of PVS data is used, unless a spline is loaded in which case
sample points from along that spline are used. The saved BSP is called
"new.bsp" and is located in the same directory as the original BSP.

Rendering of the world can be controlled via the menu. It can be
rendered in solid or wire-frame, with vertex normals, with world
sector bounding boxes, or in any combination of the above. For 
wire-frame, vertex normals and world-sector boxes, a coloring scheme 
is employed to aid the viewing of PVS data:

  Wire-frame ....... Visible in CYAN, culled in RED.

  Vertex normals ... Visible in GREEN, culled in MAGENTA.

  Sector boxes ..... Visible in YELLOW, culled in BLUE.

Rendering statistics for world-sectors and triangles are displayed in the
upper-left corner of the screen in the format ZZZ/YYY/XXX, where 

  XXX = total number in the world,
  YYY = total number in the camera's view frustum,
  ZZZ = total number in the view frustum after PVS culling.

Individual world-sectors can be similarly rendered by selecting the 
'Single sector' menu item and using the TAB key to navigate from one
world-sector to the next. Note that the displayed world-sector ID is for
user convenience only. The ordering of world-sectors in a world should
not be relied upon if, for example, the BSP is re-exported.

The World View document, clmpviewwrldview.pdf, can be found in 
docs\viewers in the RenderWare Graphics directory.

GENERAL CONTROLS

Left mouse button drag   - Tilt and turn the camera, while maintaining its
                           position. Tilt is a rotation about the camera's 
                           'right' vector; turn is a rotation about the 
                           world y-axis.

Right mouse button drag  - Translate the camera along its 'at' vector
                           while maintaining its orientation.
                           Also see the 'Translate sensitivity' menu item.

TAB                      - In 'single sector' rendering mode, make the 
                           next world-sector the current one.

CTRL + TAB               - In 'single sector' rendering mode, make the 
                           previous world-sector the current one.

SPACE                    - Toggle menu/help/plain mode.

ESC                      - Exit the application.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
MENU OPTIONS

RESET CAMERA          - Resets the camera's position, orientation and
                        view-frustum to that when the world was first
                        loaded.

RESET ON SPLINE       - Sets the camera's frame to be coincident with
                        the base-frame on the spline.

FIELD OF VIEW         - Sets the camera's horizontal field-of-view.

FAR CLIP PLANE        - Sets the distance of the far clip-plane.

NEAR CLIP PLANE       - Sets the distance of the near clip-plane.
 
CAMERA FLY            - Toggles camera momentum. If the world has a spline
                        the camera runs along it, otherwise it moves in 
                        the direction of camera's 'at' vector.

FLYING SPEED          - Sets the camera fly speed. If the world has a 
                        spline, the speed is specified in parameter-space,
                        otherwise in world-space.

TRANSLATE SENSITIVITY - Sets the sensitivity of mouse movement when the 
                        camera is translated.

TRIANGLES             - Toggles rendering of world-triangles (solid mode).

WIRE-FRAME            - Toggles wire-frame rendering of world-triangles.

NORMALS               - Toggles rendering of vertex normals.

SCALE NORMALS         - Sets scale factor used to render vertex normals.

MESH                  - If the world sectors are tristripped renders each
                        mesh that is a collection of tristrips and
                        degenerates in a separate color.

TRISTIP WITHOUT
DEGENERATES           - Renders each tristrip in a separate color.

HIGHLIGHT TRISTRIP    - Highlights in red any tristrips that are n
                        triangles in length. The length is set by the menu
                        option "Tristrip length".
                        e.g. if the length is 5 all strips with 5
                        triangles or less will be highlighted. You want to
                        try and eliminate the strips that are highlighted.

TRISTRIP LENGTH       - Select the number of triangles in a tristrip to
                        highlight for the menu options "Hihglight
                        tristrip"

WORLD-SECTORS         - Toggles rendering of world-sector bounding-boxes.

SINGLE SECTOR         - Render only the current world-sector. The current
                        world-sector may be selected using the TAB key.

SPLINE                - Toggles rendering of the spline path.

FACE CULLING          - Sets the face culling mode: FRONT, BACK or NONE.

GENERATE PVS          - Commences the generation of PVS data. Previous 
                        data is destroyed before generation starts. 
                        NOTE: Once started the process cannot be stopped 
                        and must be run to completion.

REPAIR PVS            - Updates the PVS data using visibility data 
                        obtained from a sample point coincident with the 
                        current position of the camera.

USE PVS               - Toggles use of the PVS data.

                        the position of the camera.

FPS                   - Toggles display of the number of frames per
                        second being rendered (updated every second).
