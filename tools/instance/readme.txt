                  Instance Tool for RenderWare Graphics
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The instance tool can be used to optimize RenderWare Graphics files for 
target platforms. Pre-instanced data will load faster and requires a 
smaller memory footprint. It doesn't need the 'instancing' phase that 
platform-independant RenderWare Graphics data goes through on being 
rendered the first time. Instanced data is ideal for inclusion in 
production builds.

The Instance Tool document, instance.pdf, can be found in 
docs\tools in the RenderWare Graphics directory.
